I suggest that the newest "recent changes" are on the top of the page and the older ones at the bottom.  Since they are currently in the opposite order, the reader has to scroll down to see the most recent of the "recent changes". --[[AlexanderD]]

Wow, speak and you will be heard.  Thank you, whoever is in charge of the Wiki underbelly!  Now [[RecentChanges]] is more user friendly (to me).  May I retire this page? --[[AlexanderD]]

''If the [[RecentChanges]] page is too long, edit it to remove the older entries, or lump several related changes together.''

It would also make it consistent with the Discussions page.

I am so used to scrolling to the bottom of the [[RecentChanges]] page that I scroll down the main [[CocoaDev]] page to click the [[RecentChanges]] link at the bottom. I think I can break that habit though, just give me a few weeks.

I just bookmarked the [[RecentChanges]] page. Honestly... I'm fine with it how it is. But whatever.

Since you all asked so nicely, I've scripted reverse [[RecentChanges]] and fired it off to [[StevenFrank]]. Hopefully it'll work first time :) -- [[KritTer]]

This is where we're supposed to pray.

Thanks!

it would be nice if the most recent day was also on top

''Well it is, it just needed coercing!''

Woah.  I was wondering why my page had been edited when I hadn't messed with it for a few days.  Then I realized that the newest edits are at the top now. --[[OwenAnderson]]

Yeah, I accidentally deleted all today's changes because I didn't notice... thankfully we've got history now :)
