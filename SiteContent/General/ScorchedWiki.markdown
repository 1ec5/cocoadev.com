Here's an interesting question: what are we to do about the increasing amount of information on this site?

Take the discussions page: people have asked a lot of interesting questions, but when we take the pages down they will almost certainly be lost because nobody in their right mind would want to scour [[RetiredDiscussions]], and to be honest the search facility of this site is a tad primitive. Adding the discussions to (or linking to them from) a relevant page is an option, but as we do that we risk information overload in those pages, defeating the point of doing it.

It seems plausible that most questions will only ever be asked once, suggesting we discard most conversations; if someone raises them again we hopefully will remember the old question and link it somewhere more useful. (Thus, [[RetiredDiscussions]] becomes a large junkyard people rarely go, filled with rubbish and only the occasional lost gem. After all, there's only so much information a site can contain before it becomes unusable.)

If a particular piece of information was invaluable to you when you asked a question, '''it is therefore up to you to refactor the discussion and make that information available to the community'''. That means removing the discussion format (never an aid to comprehension) and linking the information into the Wiki fabric of [[CocoaDev]] somehow. Equally, if you come across a refactored piece of information that seems to you like a waste of space, by all means raise a discussion there and then about possibly removing it.

We do need to reach a consensus here, because otherwise we'll end up with a hodge-podge of attitudes expressed in the fabric of the site. At some point, any conclusions should be added to the introductory text of the site. Opinions on a postcard (or this page, of course). Silence will be considered approval.

Explicit approval here... one might also suggest that we try to keep that in mind when writing discussion pages, yes? I.e. try to keep our discussions reasonably clear; give outlines of content. Maybe discussions should be properly structured essays? ;) -- [[RobRix]]

Well, I have added [[WhenDiscussionsConclude]]; feel free to comment here or refactor it there, whichever seems more relevant. -- [[KritTer]]
