Hi, I'm Alex Shanks. I'm a mac coder, OS X to be more specific. I recently am trying to learn Cocoa (using Obj-C).

Update: I've recently been working on a few cocoa projects and a fairly popular widget @ http://ashanks.ctsquare.net/geocaching.html

**Languages I Know:**

*General/AppleSoft Basic
*4D (some)
*HTML
*CSS
*General/JavaScript
*PHP
*General/MySQL
*Python (little)
*C/C++ (little)
*General/AppleScript

...and I'm constantly learning more Cocoa (with Obj-C)

**Projects:** (recent to oldest)

*Axle - A Web Browser In Cocoa Using The Webkit Framework (Just for personal use, and almost no "code" involved in it. It was created using a "Build Your Own Browser (BYOB)" Tutorial At General/MacDevCenter.)
*iStats - Display The Current iTunes Song In Your iChat Status In General/AppleScript. (I wrote the same thing for Yahoo! Messenger. Email Me If You'd Like The Source. It Only Has One Bug, That's The Fact That Sometimes You've Got To Force-Quit it.)
*General/PikaSong - A Random Song Generator For iTunes In General/AppleScript. Auto-Opens iTunes and Plays A Random Song. (Email Me For The Source.)
*The Fellowship of Programmers (TFP) - Co-Founding A Programming Organization
*Mventory - **DEAD!** A Commercial Inventory System In 4D, (never completed)
*General/AxlePage - A Single-Paged, Text File-Based Wiki In PHP
*aSlot - **FORGOTTEN!** A Very 'Ol Style Slot Machine. My First C++ Program, Very Boring. I wonder if the source is still on my hd...

As said earlier, I co-founded "The Fellowship of Programmers" (TFP), a rather new organization for programmers of all sorts of languages. See it at http://www.tfprog.com

I'm beginning into Cocoa, and am trying to start a software company, developing Cocoa, and Python products, with web design possibly? Who knows...
