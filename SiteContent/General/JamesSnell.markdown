I'm a Computer Scientist & Computer Engineering student from the University of Calgary, Canada. I greatly enjoy investigating hardware considerations. In my spare time I work on a research project of mine centered around a general purpose computer architecture I'm creating.

I work as an intern and am relatively new to Mac OS X development.
