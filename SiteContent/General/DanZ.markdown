Err.... placeholder for now.

I can be most often found running or cycling the beaches of Southern California, training for triathlons (swimming is my weak point). Less often I'm dancing with fire (http://homepage.mac.com/quellish/General/MoonCircles/General/MoonCircles.html) or working on some of my own Cocoa projects.

Probably best known as a mac 3d guy and heavy advocate of QuickDraw3D and General/QuickTime.
