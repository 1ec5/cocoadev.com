There seems to be a trend among users of this site to write their bios in third-person. The heck with that. I'm far too much of an egoist not to take any opportunity to write in the first person.

Me, in a nutshell: I went to school for a while, back in the late 1980's and early 1990's. It didn't suit me. I then worked as an artist for the better part of a decade, where I developed a passing interest in and intuitive understanding of the Macintosh. In the late 1990's, I got sidetracked into being a system administrator, program writer, and entrepreneur. I did the dot-com thing for a while, but when I went from being just another guy with a good idea and a working knowledge of C++ to a C-level manager of a growing company, it became evident that I was out of my depth.

Since September, 2002, I've been working on a novel and writing little programs on the side for fun. Soon, however, I will be completely out of that sweet, sweet dot-com cash, and I'll have to find something that's less fun but more lucrative. I have no idea what that will be yet.

I have a blog: http://homepage.mac.com/jharrell

I like to pretend I'm kind of embarrassed by the whole thing, but in point of fact I'm always telling people about it, making something of a nuisance of myself. I lure people to my blog with the promise of '''FREE STUFF'''. In particular, you can download a small collection of short stories that I've written, as well as the first N chapters of my nearly-complete novel, where N is a small integer that at the moment happens to equal three.

You can also read stuff about me that's far too intimately personal to discuss in polite company. But, like a cat, I am obstinately unashamed.
