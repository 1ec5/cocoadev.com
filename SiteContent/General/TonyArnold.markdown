I am one of those know everything, do nothing types. A millennia ago I cleaned up [[CocoaDev]]'s appearance. I used to look after [[VirtueDesktops]], but am now writing it's (commercial) successor, Hyperspaces (http://hyperspacesapp.com). I help out where I can, and fiddle with things I shouldn't -- http://undocumented-goodness.googlecode.com/
