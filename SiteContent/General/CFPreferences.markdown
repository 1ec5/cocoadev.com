The General/CoreFoundation Preference Services.

This collection of functions lets you do things that the Cocoa General/NSUserDefaults System doesn't yet expose (General/NSUserDefaults is built on top of General/CFPreferences).

For example, setting individual values in General/PreferenceSuites that aren't attached to a single app. Also, setting General/PreferencesByHost.
