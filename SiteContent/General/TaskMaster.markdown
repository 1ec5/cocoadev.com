[[BradCox]]'s paper describing an extensible programming system for users of all skill levels. It also includes a description of "action expressions," or [[CodeBlocks]] (Blocks in [[SmallTalk]]-80).

Some of the ideas it highlights are a lightweight multitasking and I/O system, and simple exception handling. [[CodeBlocks]]/action expressions are a potent little concept.
