Cocoa Novice (probably always will be ;) and old.
Started programming with a Univac 1005.  (4k memory, 80 col carder reader, 132 line printer and a weird sort of kinda base 10 computer)
Really liked IBM 370 Assembler for OS/VS1 and OS/MVS with a specialty in CICS (old mainframe stuff)
Like C, Objective-C, Cocoa and almost anything [[MacOSX]] :D
Dislike M$ Windows and C++
