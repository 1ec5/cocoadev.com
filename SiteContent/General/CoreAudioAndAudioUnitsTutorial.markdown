This space available to write a General/CoreAudio tutorial or add insights. Some areas in which the original poster was interested:

- Reading an audio file (actually using General/QTSoundFilePlayer)

- Directing this audio to other General/AudioUnit (General/QTSoundFilePlayer, but generating audio outputs, not directed to another kind of General/AudioUnit)

- Move the file reader to a particular time position in the file (General/QTSoundFilePlayer can do this, but what if I don't use it)

- Drawing an image of the waveform (not really an audio project, but an General/NSView project)
