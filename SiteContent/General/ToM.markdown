[[ToM]]'s name is spelled Tom when he's not elbowing his way onto a Wiki. He's been stuffing around with Cocoa and Objective-C for about five years, but it's not a career. It's merely an obsessional, all-devouring hobby. He probably should get out more. 

Website: Used to be www dot pixelballistics dot com, but now moved to [[LuaForge]] (for [[LuaObjCBridge]]) and [[SourceForge]] (for [[ALeA]]).

Current Projects:


*[[LuaObjCBridge]], a Lua/Objective-C Bridge (visit [[LuA]] for the guts of it)
*[[ALeA]], a Cocoa application for creating, editing and playing adventure games. Just released as BSD-licensed source - enjoy!
