General/ToM's name is spelled Tom when he's not elbowing his way onto a Wiki. He's been stuffing around with Cocoa and Objective-C for about five years, but it's not a career. It's merely an obsessional, all-devouring hobby. He probably should get out more. 

Website: Used to be www dot pixelballistics dot com, but now moved to General/LuaForge (for General/LuaObjCBridge) and General/SourceForge (for General/ALeA).

Current Projects:


*General/LuaObjCBridge, a Lua/Objective-C Bridge (visit General/LuA for the guts of it)
*General/ALeA, a Cocoa application for creating, editing and playing adventure games. Just released as BSD-licensed source - enjoy!
