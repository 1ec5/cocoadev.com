eScience by day, physics by night, and Cocoa (with marshmellows) in between. I am a 'bloody yank' who has seen the error of my ways and moved to Melbourne Australia (believe it or not, arriving 9/11/2001), with prior, life experience, stops in Boston, Palo Alto, and Seattle. Started programming with punchcards and Fortran, now objective-c; thank you Apple and all those out there in General/CocoaDev land for showing the way to coder nirvana.
