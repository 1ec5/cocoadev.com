I've been a Mac developer since the original release of OS X. I'm currently attending the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where I am a member of the [[MacWarriors]] MUG.

Currently the only major project that I'm involved with is [[NicePlayer]].

Previously, I've been a part in the development of:

  * The iTunes Music Recommendation System
  * [[TrailBlazer]]
  * 3DOSX
  * [[PrintSelection]]
  * [[ActiveTimer]]
