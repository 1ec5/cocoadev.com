Living in Auburn CA. A big DVD Site at http://www.digitallyobsessed.com, a weblog about [[AppleScript]] Studio and Cocoa at http://www.blankreb.com/studiolog.php, I have another weblog at http://www.blankreb.com/jesselog.php which follows my passions for all things Mac, Oklahoma Sooner Sports and Chess.

I enjoy visiting this site to see the Cocoa bits provided and I link to them in my Studio Log when they are applicable. I have been using [[AppleScript]] for years as a tool to do large tasks more quickly. With the release of [[AppleScriptStudio]], I have spent more and more time in Project Builder. I have two books on Cocoa and, although it is tough because my programming fundamentals are weak, I am making a go of real live Cocoa Programming.
