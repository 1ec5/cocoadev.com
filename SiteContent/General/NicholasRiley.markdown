Current Cocoa projects:


* [[ICeCoffEE]] - it's [[ICeTEe]] for Cocoa.  Command-click to launch a URL in any [[NSTextView]], Tiger or Leopard Terminal, or [[WebKit]] view.  Customizable Services menu (with icons!) in contextual menus.
* [[FScriptAnywhere]] - dynamically embed F-Script into any Cocoa application. Useful for debugging and just general messing around.
* Pester - a simple alarm application.
