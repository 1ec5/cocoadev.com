Current Cocoa projects:


* General/ICeCoffEE - it's General/ICeTEe for Cocoa.  Command-click to launch a URL in any General/NSTextView, Tiger or Leopard Terminal, or General/WebKit view.  Customizable Services menu (with icons!) in contextual menus.
* General/FScriptAnywhere - dynamically embed F-Script into any Cocoa application. Useful for debugging and just general messing around.
* Pester - a simple alarm application.
