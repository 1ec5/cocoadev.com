Quoting Uli: 

"This [[NSTableView]]-like class displays items in a way similar to the Finder's "Icon View". It can use any [[NSCell]] for displaying items, and the items can be arbitrarily positioned. 

Furthermore, selection of items is handled for you, and items can be rearranged in a number of ways. When embedded in an [[NSScrollView]], a distributed view will automatically resize to fit around all its items, and you can snap item positions to a grid. 

This version increases performance, adds basic inter-application drag-and-drop support and a Finder-style [[NSCell]] subclass."
