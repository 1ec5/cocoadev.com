General/CodexFab is a DSA based alternative to General/AquaticPrime. 

General/CodexFab aims to make it simple for you to add automatic General/PotionStore licensing support to your Cocoa app.

This project demonstrates the code necessary to generate and validate a General/CocoaFob license code string. It also provides a class, General/XMDSAKeyGenerator, to wrap the task of generating DSA keys using openssl.

The General/CodexFab application is designed to generate and validate DSA keys to test your project's implementation of General/CocoaFob.

General/CodexFab is based on General/CocoaFob, an open source project by Gleb Dolgich that implements secure assymetric DSA key generation and validation in Cocoa and Ruby. 

General/CocoaFob and General/CodexFab are both designed to work with the General/PotionStore. http://github.com/potionfactory/potionstore/tree/master

See the companion General/LicenseExample project for sample code implementing General/CocoaFob licensing within a Cocoa app. We have tried to make this as complete a solution as possible, and there is very little work left for you to do.
