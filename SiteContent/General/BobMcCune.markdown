Hi, my name is Bob Mc<nowiki/>Cune. I'm a software developer and independent consultant in the Twin Cities area of MN.  I am also the chapter organizer of the Minnesota Cocoa<nowiki/>Heads group.  The goal of our group is to build a community of people interested in developing software for the Macintosh and iPhone platforms.  We do this at our monthly meetings through informal presentations, hands on coding, and discussion.  For more information, stop by the Minnesota Cocoa<nowiki/>Heads website.
