I was a web application developer, looking to expand into application development on Mac OS X.  I have been at it a few years and have two shareware titles going: [[BombSquad]] and [[NetScrape]].  More info at http://www.positivespinmedia.com

I reside in Billings, Montana, USA.  I welcome contact from any Cocoa developer within 500 miles... it's a little lonely out here :-)
