Describe General/PalmOSDevelopment here. - It's frustrating!

*From a discussion on General/PalmOS*:

Slightly off-topic for General/CocoaDev, but I have yet to find any way to develop General/PalmOS programs on General/MacOSX.  Could someone point me in the right direction? (feel free to remove this if it's too OT)

Simplicity offers a Java tool called Simplicity for Palm that is good (as well as Simplicity for MIDP, which will work for both Palm and Windows General/PDAs). I use both on Mac OS X. The only problem is that you cannot create .prc files on a Mac -- you need a PC to do that. :-P  Of course, you can probably do that step on General/VirtualPC.

Check out the page: http://www.zenonez.com/prctoolsx/try.html prc-tools is a gcc-based environment for palm dev. It works well enough on OS X, except for a problem I've been having with General/PalmBlueToothDevelopment. If anyone knows some secrets, please post on that page! Thanks...
