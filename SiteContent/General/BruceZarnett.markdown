I'm a long-time Mac user starting with a Mac+ and then moving up the line including a few Performas, a Quadra, and SE, and my latest, a General/GeeFour Ti-book. I also got my start with computer consulting with a Mac doing Supercard, and C programming with Think-C.

I've recently returned to the Mac (after a short stint during OS 8) of being Linux based, and am getting back into Objective-C and some Cocoa stuff.

I am also an instructor in the martial arts of Xing Yi Quan and Ba gua Zhang.
