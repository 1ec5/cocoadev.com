I'm starting to test some new code on an x86 box running General/FreeBSD and General/GNUstep. I'm also working on an Xcode setup to edit the code on my G5 and build the x86 code remotely using RPC calls. It's going to be a simple setup, but before I get really deep into it I was wondering if anyone else here is doing the same thing? --zootbobbalu
