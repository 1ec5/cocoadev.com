Is anyone familiar with the equations used in General/NSAnimation with easein/easeout etc?

Thank you,

The search function on this wiki really is quite useful ... :-)  See: General/AnimationTechniquesAndCocoa for a general topic page and links to other relevant pages. That's a good starting point.

No I took the time to do that before, what I was hoping someone could shed some light on is how easineaseout is an S curve, and thus maybe point me to the appropriate s curve equation.  What I'm doing requires my animations to be as similar as possible to Apple's standard ones, but without using General/NSAnimation.
