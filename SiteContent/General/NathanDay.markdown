You can find the following source code projects on my site.

*[[NDAlias]] - Class to represent existing paths with a Alias Record
*[[NDScript]] - Classes for compiling and executing [[AppleScript]], includes code for manipulating [[NSAppleEventDescriptors]]
*[[NDLaunchServices]] - Simple wrapper class for Launch Services
*[[NDProcess]] - Class for obtaining information about processes.
*[[NDResourceFork]] - Class for reading, writting and manipulating resource forks.
*[[NDRunLoopMessenger]] - Class for interthread communication, in a way similar to DO but with about half the overhead.
*[[NDFiber]] - Class for cooperative threads.


You can also find the Application Popup Dock on my web site. This is a Application that provides extra docks (subdocks) which can be accessed from Apples Dock.

I found your stuff really useful (I've used, ndalias and ndresourcefork) but I don't like having a lot of 3rd party classes scattered around my project so I decided to combine them in a framework.
