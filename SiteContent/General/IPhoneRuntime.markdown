As announced at M<nowiki/>acWorld 2007, the iPhone runs a stripped-down version of OS X, including General/CoreFoundation and many other familiar frameworks.

While there is currently no publicly-available SDK for the iPhone, General/SteveJobs has announced that Apple plans to have one available in February 2008.  Until then, **use the information in this section at your own risk, as it is liable to change at any time.**

**Warning!** Installing third-party applications on your iPhone may violate the terms of your contract, void your warranty, or may even render your shiny and expensive new toy into a shiny but useless brick.
