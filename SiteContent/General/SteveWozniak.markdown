[[SteveWozniak]] is the often forgotten co-founder of Apple who did all the inventing. Jobs was just the business front.

Steve Wozniak is both a great mind and a great person. After leaving Apple back in the 80s he started teaching to common children in schools (something I personally admire). He is one of the very few "famous" people who have always been able to be truly themselves. Also, he is officially one of the 100 best minds of US history (or something like that, can't remember the site where there is the list).

According to what I heard, he also donated a lot of money to the creation of a toy museum in San Jose. That is the reason there is a road in San Jose called 'Woz Way'. :)

Check out woz.org - it's even got a wozcam!

He's a great person alright - and if anyone fits the cliche 'generous to a fault' it's Steve Wozniak. The guy replies to loads of emails from people he doesn't know (for 8-20 hours a day according to his website - and I bet every person he replies to feels special because someone as famous/smart/humorous as him replied to them), and he even phoned me on my birthday just because my sister asked him to. Then when my Mac was held for ransom he gave me an iBook. Wow. There are some articles about it linked from http://acronyms.co.nz/fame/ if anyone wants to know more.

Latest enterprise to emerge from [[SteveWozniak]]. The company's website is: http://woz.com/

As revealed in July 2003, they are apparently working on a low-power, long-range (up to two miles) wireless "locator" network to help people keep track of items, both animate and inanimate. Keys, laptops, briefcases, pets, kids, anything that might go astray.  The network is called wOzNet.
