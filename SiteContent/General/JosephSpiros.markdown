Hobbies include, among other things, inserting silly comments into other people's pages (namely [[AdamAtlas]]' and [[KentSutherland]]'s) under my pseudonym, [[DreadedWoeKitten]] :p

Isn't that a bit.. silly?

Yes, indeed, it is. But, Silly is good, when used sparingly.

I believe you should save silliness for your '''own''' page. -- [[AdamAtlas]]

Put a "no silliness, please" sign on your page, perhaps. Of course, then you'll get solicitors.

But isn't [[AdamAtlas]] a solicitor anyway? I read somewhere that he's some kind of lawyer... ;)

This is true...
