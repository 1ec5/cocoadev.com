Hobbies include, among other things, inserting silly comments into other people's pages (namely General/AdamAtlas' and General/KentSutherland's) under my pseudonym, General/DreadedWoeKitten :p

Isn't that a bit.. silly?

Yes, indeed, it is. But, Silly is good, when used sparingly.

I believe you should save silliness for your **own** page. -- General/AdamAtlas

Put a "no silliness, please" sign on your page, perhaps. Of course, then you'll get solicitors.

But isn't General/AdamAtlas a solicitor anyway? I read somewhere that he's some kind of lawyer... ;)

This is true...
