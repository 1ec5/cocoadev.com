'''Dave Fayram''' is a graduate of the University of California, Santa Barbara with a BSCS and a fervent desire to work in the industry, especially with Apple products. He's worked for Lockheed Martin, and now works for Powerset as a software engineer doing Ruby, C and Erlang development and integration.

I also managed to get some research work done in  months before I graduated for an amazing professor at UCSB. It involved making an IDS (Intrusion Detection System) for IBM's mobile code environment "Aglets" ( http://sourceforge.net/projects/aglets/ ). I came out of this research with a free trip to Barcelona, Spain, a published paper at the now disbanded MATA2002 proceedings, and a good understanding of network security and mobile code.

One of these days I'm going to make a Ruby Mobile Code environment. I swear. My Professor keeps laughing and says that I am not, but I'll throw it in his face one day. The paper he and I wrote is here: http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~vigna/pub/2002_vigna_cassell_fayram_ma02.pdf

I kind of got out of Cocoa while I busied myself finishing college and working on my research (and playing with Ruby, wow what a language for fun coding). I had some grand dreams before but right now I'm way more concerned with finding a job. I don't care if it's Cocoa, Java in general, C/C++ work, or selling you stuff at [[CompUSA]]. I need to pay for my car insurance somehow! :)

I'm a Cocoa intermediate. I'm also a language purist, meaning I really dislike a lot of languages that many people know, and thusly find attractive. C++ and Perl come to mind. How anyone can enjoy working in languages as convoluted and chaotic as this continues to amaze me. Not that I don't know themmind you, but a man has to have his principles. 

People keep telling me to look at C#. I just can't bring myself to like anything about .NET though, even if C# really is a nicer language than Java. 

If you happen to be interested in seeing my resumï¿½, please, feel free to email me at dfayram@lensmen.net or contact me via AIM through the name [[KirinDave]]. Heck, I'll do anything.
