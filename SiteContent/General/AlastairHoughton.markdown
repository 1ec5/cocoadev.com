I own, run and work for Coriolis Systems Limited < http://www.coriolis-systems.com >.

I used to maintain an unofficial FAQ for the Cocoa-dev list, but lately I've been much too busy (sadly).

Occasionally, when I'm not so busy, I might post something interesting on my weblog < http://www.alastairs-place.net >.
