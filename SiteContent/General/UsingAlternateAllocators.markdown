This is just a question out of curiousity, not a request for assistance. I generally use malloc()/free() when I need blocks of memory that aren't objects, but what do other people use? Does anyone use [[NSZoneMalloc]](), [[CFAllocatorAllocate]](), or (Carbon represent!) [[NewPtr]](), and if so, why?
----
I generally use [[NSMutableData]].  Just like malloc(), [[NSMutableData]] will provide a void pointer that I can cast to the type I want to actually store, ï¿½ mutableBytes.  [[NSMutableData]] also provides an automatic realloc() capability, -increaseLengthBy:.  [[NSMutableData]] can provide small chuncks and huge chunks equally well.  Best of all, using [[NSMutableData]] lets me use Cocoa's memory management conventions unbiquitously.  I never have to worry about free() or who should free memory allocated within a function call etc.
