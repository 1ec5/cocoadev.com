General/TeXShop (open source cocoa project) is a very good front end for General/TeX and General/LaTeX for OS X: http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~koch/texshop/texshop.html .

General/ITexMac (open source cocoa project) is a very good front end for General/TeX and General/LaTeX for OS X: http://itexmac.sourceforge.net/ .
