From the Mulle-Kybernetik site:

"The origins of the General/EDCommon und General/EDMessage frameworks date back to 1997 
and the original General/NeXT implementation of the General/OpenStep standard. Most of 
their components have been thoroughly tested and refined through years 
of use in General/OpenSource as well as in commercial projects. General/EDCommon also 
has full Apple-style reference documentation for all classes and other General/APIs."
