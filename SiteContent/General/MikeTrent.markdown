Mike Trent used to lurk [[CocoaDev]] and the [[VersionTracker]] user reviews. He tended to complain a lot and otherwise be a nuisance. He was also is an on-again-off-again technical reviewer for computer books, including:


*[[BookMacOSXADT]] 
*[[BookProgInObjC]] 
*Learning Emacs 3rd Edition 
 

Mike spent much of 2004 and 2005 working with Drew [[McCormack]] and others on a book on Beginning Mac OS X programming: http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0764573993/104-9419933-4839133 . Unlike other books in the space right now, this book doesn't focus its attention exclusively on Cocoa (or carbon). It should be a useful tutorial for someone who wants to learn more about the developer tools, languages, and so on provided with Mac OS X.

Since then Mike quietly worked on other projects, and hasn't really been around here much.

Mike's last non-commercial Mac OS X freeware endeavor is '''Old Glory''', available on [[VersionTracker]]: http://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macos/11935 . Mike made a lot of people very angry when he said he would not give permission for them to hack up Old Glory and re-post it with other graphics files. He regrets the situation but there it is. Another screen saver project is [[FadeFromBlack]], available from his .mac account.

Prior to this his last major open-source contribution to the Cocoa community was '''[[FreeSpace]]''', a screen saver engine for Mac OS X Server 1.1. Though [[FreeSpace]] does not work on Mac OS X 10.0, it's still a good source example for a program that wants to use [[NSBundles]] to load plug-ins. [[FreeSpace]] totally rocked on Rhapsody for Intel DR2 ... but now it is just a memory. And anyway, Mac OS X's built-in [[ScreenSaver]] is much better.

He doesn't have any [[CopiousFreeTime]] anymore (damn ... what the hell am I doing with my life?!?), but he'll make time to answer questions about just about anything.
