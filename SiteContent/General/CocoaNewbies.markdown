For anyone who is new to Cocoa and is afraid to post a discussion (I know I was long ago), feel free to contact myself or anyone who adds their name to this list.

Check out General/HowToProgramInOSX and let me know what you think here.  It is just a draft, so please add your insight to it.

Also, there's often somebody in the General/CocoaDev General/ChatRoom who'll be happy to help (but it is rarely active).
