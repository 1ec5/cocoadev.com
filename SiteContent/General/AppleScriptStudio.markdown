Introduced with the December 2001 developer tools and/or OS X 10.1.2, General/AppleScriptStudio (or - short and naughty - ASS) refers to the combination of tools (General/ProjectBuilder and General/InterfaceBuilder) and frameworks that allow an General/AppleScript application to access Cocoa objects. You can even mix General/AppleScript and Cocoa code within the same application.

Also, if you've got ASS already installed with the Dec 2001 dev tools, check your hard drive here:
