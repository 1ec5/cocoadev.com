Describe [[NicolasOjedaBar]] here.


I am a 18 years old Mathematics student from Buenos Aires, Argentina. I started programming when I was 13 years old. I didn't know anybody who could teach me so  I had to learn everything by myself (I remember that I thought that programs were written using DOS .[[BATs]] !!).

The first language I learned thoroughly was C++. After that came straigth C, Pascal (I know, strange progression), Prolog, Lisp, Scheme, Smalltalk, ML, TCL and, finally, I discovered Objective-C.

I just love [[ProjectBuilder]]/[[InterfaceBuilder]]. I think they have a huge potential.

Right now I am writing a Cocoa IRC Client, just to really get to know the Foundation/Application Kit.

Well, that's about everything ...!
