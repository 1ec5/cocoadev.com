What class would I use to create a program that would allow me to change the maximum sound volume?  Basically I want to create a little app that would set the volume to a certain level beyond which the whole system can't get any louder.   I've looked into General/NSSound, which doesn't appear to be what I need.  Any suggestions?

Apple's General/CoreAudio will let you do this.
