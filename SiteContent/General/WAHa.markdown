My real name is Dag ï¿½gren. I code in C, Objective-C, C++, Perl, and various other languages. Some of my works are available at http://wakaba.c3.cx/s/.

I have created the following pieces of code available on [[CocoaDev]]:


*  A simple regex wrapper called [[CSRegex]].
* An implementation of [[CoRoutine]]''''s for Cocoa called [[CSCoroutine]].
* A function to [[ParseDSStoreFiles]].
* A category to make [[NSDataHexDump]]''''s, for easier reading.
* A small tool to [[ListAllDeclaredTypeIdentifiers]].
* A Perl script that uses the above program to parse an Info.plist and [[ExportTypeIdentifiers]].
* A piece of code I claim to be the [[StupidestCocoaCodeEver]].
