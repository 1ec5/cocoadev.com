I personally don't think [[DashBoard]] or [[SpotLight]] are rip offs at all... I started this page to filter that argument out of pages discussing the new technologies benefits and [[APIs]].  Here's a place for those who want to rant to come.... note that the first set below has been /refactored/ out of another useful page, so that the flames don't get in the way of people that want to move forward. '''One of the refactored "flames" is mine, and I disagree that it's a flame.  I agree we should move to a dedicated page, because it's a dedicated issue, and a legitmate concern, I feel.  As developers, we need to understand how to survive making cocoa apps, and that involves understanindg how apple treats its developer base.'''

'''Sure, apple's versions of things are usually pretty cool.  Apple has by far the best OS in my opinion, and an absolutely incredible set of developer technologies (read: cocoa).  Apple has the resources (money, man power and inside know how) to put together some really cool stuff.  However, they ripped konfabulator, and they ripped launchbar (for spotlight).  Spotlight is a lot cooler than launchbar, but obdev could never make launchbar spotlight, because they're not in the position to (inside know how / access to OS).  Apple would be a lot cooler if they bought the rights to those products and then modified them or even rewritten them if necessary... but ripping the ideas is not cool, even if improving on them.  Apple did this with iTunes; they saw something liked, baught it, tweaked it, and got one of their number 1 killer iApps.  No shame in that.'''

''There is also no shame in copying ideas. It's legal and moral, and it happens all the time. If you want the exclusive right to a particular idea, get a patent on it; that's what they're for. Without a patent, writing an app that does something resembling somebody else's app is normal practice. It's entirely beyond me why people think Apple should pay some developers money for their app, then toss it out and rewrite it from scratch anyway. Apple is not a charity and it does not owe its developers free money.''

[[SpotLight]] is in no way a rip off of [[LaunchBar]]... Apple has had search technology built in since at least system 6 (my experience doesn't go back further than that...) Since when did [[LaunchBar]] and others ([[QuickSilver]], Butler...) do full content indexing of every pdf file you have?  since when did they allow you to use multiple search conditions and save it as a folder in the finder that automatically updates its files?  Since when did they let you extend their searching ability into your custom data or conversely allow you to embed their searching capabilities into your app...  since when do they let you find the Wallpaper preference given the key "desktop"?  [[SpotLight]] is a much bigger, better search engine than any of these... it's more tightly integrated with the rest of the system, and it's extendable AND embeddable.  That it allows you to accomplish similar tasks in similar ways is an EXTREMELY superficial glance at what it is... Besides, according to [[SteveJobs]] it's a rip off of [[LongHorn]] (if it can be called that when [[LongHorn]] hasn't been released yet...)

Yes, spotlight does a shitload more things than launchbar, for sure.  But, as I said, Apple has the ability to snatch up one man operations and turn them into these massive jaugernauts.  Apple is in the '''position''' to do some of the fancier searching.  Stuff that I don't think obdev could have pulled off so quickly.  Launchbar was out of the gates way ahead of apple, but apple has more men on the job, and when after a short period they've lapped obdev, you can't give credit to the inguinity at apple, but rather to the size of apple.  

I'm not saying that no one should copy; that would be a bad thing and would be a serious obstacle to moving technology forward.  But one can pay tribute in a variety of ways to the original author(s).  Not paying tribute to the original authors is called plagiarism in the academic community.  Not paying tribute also drives the people whose good ideas you took out of buisiness, killing off a source of inovation that clearly benefits Apple (especially when they tap that inovation).  Getting a patent so as to ensure that people pay you for your ideas is really something only larger developers can do, primarily because of financial constraints.  Apple is always more than happy to shutdown any operation that resembles in any way shape or form anything they're doing.  Not because the offense is different, but because the players are different.  Apple is a cool company, no doubt, but Steve occasionally does things that are not so cool; this is one of them.

As one of the primary [[OPs]] I will also post what the opposition has to say.  Read about it here http://daringfireball.net/2004/06/dashboard_vs_konfabulator

This is just so lame... okay, so Apple took a few ideas and came up with thousands themselves, which others constantly steal all the time. What were they supposed to do? Would it be cool if Apple would never implement a decent program-cycler (command-tab) because a shareware application already did this? And didn't [[LiteSwitchX]] already steel from Apple, since Apple did the rounded transparent windows before [[LiteSwitchX]].

And calling [[SpotLight]] for [[LaunchBar]] is pretty far fetched. I don't even think [[SpotLight]] does addaptive abbreviation search, which is the only real innovative feature of [[LaunchBar]] (although there have previously been systems which did phonetic search, systems where functionality was reached through abbreviations, and also addaptive systems -- but [[LaunchBar]] "did it right", I'll say that) � but [[LaunchBar]] was one good idea 8 years ago, should that mean [[OBDev]] can retire and live the rest of their lifes on the income generated by [[LaunchBar]], and no-one else can even touch the searching domain, because it was their idea? ''Pure straw man. People weren't complaining about competition in general. They were saying Apple should not compete with its own third-party developers as a point of ethics. The Mac shareware market is tough enough without the guys who make the computer trying to stomp you out of existence.'' despite the fact that writing a [[LaunchBar]] clone would only take a few days, so it's not like [[OBDev]] looses millions in research because of plagiarism, which is the sole reason for patents! so stop thinking that if [[OBDev]] had been a big guy, they'd have patented their idea and come after Apple, I know the US patent system is flawed, but the idea with patents is not to patent ideas and secure your future through passive income.

'''Not sure what your issue is with [[OBDev]], but they have turned out version after version after version, each one with a host of improvements in both speed/reliability/performance and feature set.  Not exactly what I would call "passive income".  They have a great product, I love them, and have happily paid for every copy I use on each of my machines.  I hope they stay in buiseness despite Apple's agressive attitude towards its developer base'''

''I have absolutely nothing against [[OBDev]], on the contrary, I think they did a very cool piece of software. When I mentioned them in my rant above it was sort of in response to reading this:'' http://www.toomuchsexy.org/index/weblog/comments/should_launchbar_be_patented and now seeing people say that [[SpotLight]] is a [[LaunchBar]] rip-off � ''so my grief is with ''users'' not the [[OBDev]] developers, as they have said nothing about the subject to the best of my knowledge, unlike e.g. Proterons open memo to Apple:'' http://proteron.com/liteswitchx/openmemo.php

And here's what Dave Hyatt says about Dashboard:

''From a browser geek's perspective, the Dashboard is a collection of HTML sidebar panels liberated from the browser window and placed anywhere on your screen. The "Web pages as widgets" concept is really just a logical extension of the Web sidebar panel metaphor fused with Expose.''

http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/hyatt/archives/2004_06.html#005887

'''Yet strangely, nobody but Hyatt seems to have thought of the similarity to the Web sidebar panel. Everybody else noticed some kind of similarity to Konfabulator.'''

''Maybe because he has previously worked on Mozilla and Mac users generally haven't, nor do they use that browser!?!''

Not really arguing about the konfabulator thing b/c I think konfabulator was pretty useless.... (oops).  And I '''do''' think that Apple has a pretty sweet version.  Not talking about [[LiteSwitchX]] b/c as you point out, what made it so good was that it was copying an Apple designed UI.  On the other hand, Dashboard, from a user's perspective serves the exact same purpose.  Apple just put Konfabulator out of buisiness.  I don't buy the story about "widgets" being Desk Accessories.  They aren't.  [[DAs]] were standalone apps; they did not in any way integrate with anything elese; all IO was with the user via the screen and kbd/mouse.  Widgets in konfabulator control iTunes, consume web services etc.  They serve an entirely different purpose; they are also easily creatable by any joe shmo; [[DAs]] were not, and I think the comparison is a stretch.

''If the Konfab guys are smart, they won't be put out of business. They have a year to come up with a way to set themselves apart from Apple, either by improving their product or making new products. However, they choose to complain and make people feel sorry for themselves instead of putting their nose to the grindstone and working. They have no right to a monopoly on their idea forever.''

I'm not saying apple shouldn't ever touch anything that some third party did once upon a time; that's stupid and would prevent the OS from ever going forward, collecting good ideas and improving on them with time; I'm saying they should give credit where it's due.  MS doesn't, and we all hate MS for various reasons, but that's definately one of them.  Apple was semi-noble in dealing with the watson-sherlock3 fiasco, they certaintly were with iTunes, and I think at least a nod to people have done similar work would be appropriate -- it's what in academia you call "references".  [[LiteSwitch]] found a hole in the OS and filled it.  It was Apple's oversight/fault that they didn't fill that functionality gap themselves.  When [[LiteSwitch]] filled that hole, Apple owed it to [[LightSwitch]] to say, "Thanks for pointing out a problem and addressing it, too.  Good job."  [[LiteSwitch]] wasn't a very complicated app to say the least, but credit was owed, and not paid.

''Oh come on, that's so ridiculous. I released App Switcher months before the first version of [[LiteSwitchX]] shipped; did they owe me a "Thanks for pointing that out"? Of course not! Maybe Apple should have said "thanks" to Microsoft for including the idea in every version of Windows since at least 3.1. Or maybe they should have simply done what they did, since the idea of "alt-tab program switcher" is such a mundane idea that acknowledging a fellow copier of that idea would be incredibly stupid.''

'''I also think the legal department at Apple would argue rather strongly against Apple saying: "thanks, we did copy you!"'''

'''Not sure if the reference to Watson above refers to how Apple actually did offer the Watson developer a job at Apple (something I was not aware of during the controversy).'''

There have been cases where Apple acknowledged using an existing idea -- look at last years WWDC where Steve Jobs got up on stage and said 'fast user switching - Microsoft beat us to it, but we do it better'.
----
You guys are missing the essence of my point.  Acknowledging MS is hard not to do; they are by far the biggest player in the game, and everybody knows of them, and almost everybody knows about them.  But more to the point, taking a good idea from MS and not giving them credit for it will not put MS out of buiseness, thereby squelching a good source of ideas.  Small third party developers on the other hand, who do have good ideas, or ideas that are good enough for Apple to copy, might no longer be in a position to suply those good ideas if you kill their buisness.  They are usually fragile, weak one man shows that Apple can squash.  Just becease they can, doesn't mean they should.  It's clearly bad for the third party developer, but I argue that it's bad for Apple and the Mac community in general, to lose that good source of ideas.  

To be fair though, I should point out that Watson has miraculously survived Sherlock, though that maybe because sherlock is so painfully slow and the channels are significantly less reliable.  Phonebook in Sherlock for instance, rarely finds the number I need (No results found), whereas Watson either has better content searching or uses more sources, not exactly sure which, but even if the results were identical, Sherlock runs on an order of magnitude slower.  Launchbar's future, I think is in doubt, and I think Konfabulator could survive in theory, beceause there is time to come up with something competitive, but because it's such a small operation, I doubt they have the resources to pull anything off.

''A good, well-executed program is not a lifetime supply of money. If a small-time developer structures his entire living around a single program that could be easily copied, that's a severe lack of planning and it's nobody's fault but his own when that's yanked out from underneath him. You need variety, adaptability, and willingness to change to survive. You will have competition, whether from Apple or not. If these guys play their cards right, Apple won't destroy them. If they sit by and passively watch as Apple takes over their space, they will lose it, but that is their own fault. The fact that Watson has survived shows that it's not certain doom.''

'''You mean the fact that Karelia just dropped Watson like a hot potato?''' http://www.karelia.com/watson/watsonFAQ.html

One hundred percent disagree.  Apple has the power to take something and make it uber-cool in the blink of an eye.  If they take over your idea and you're a small thirdpart developer, you're not ''competing''; you've been forced out and Apple establishes a monopoly on what was your product space.  Watson is a rare examle, and if it survived it's becuase Sherlock is the one out of a thousand, when Apple does something that really stinks.  Can you say "[[OpenDoc]]"?

''[[LiteSwitchX]], Watson, [[OmniWeb]], [[CodeWarrior]], every e-mail and music app out there, every calendar app, photo organizer, these are all proof that competition from Apple is not a death sentence. Yes, Apple is certainly in a better position than a small developer in some respects, but not in all respects; an individual developer is more agile and can give more attention to detail. But answer a question: if Apple decides that they should put a feature into their OS that already exists in some form as a third-party utility, but they want to do it completely differently, what should they do? Should they pay the developer of the third-party utility some money, delete his code, and get started on their own? Should they use his code, even though the end result wouldn't be as good? Should they just forget about it and not make their OS as good as they could? Or should they go ahead with the original plan and do their own work without paying anybody free money? Obviously, I think that the last one is the way to go.''

Yet it's funny that the agileness of a small developer usually doesn't pay off because Apple's products are almost always better than a small developer's products. I say let apple make whatever they want because it's sure going to be better than the other guys.

We live in a capitalist world, copying of ideas happens. Move along now, nothing to see here.

---- 

[[CAPitalist]] has nothing to do w/ copying ideas; patents can protect ideas, if you have the money and legal manuverability to obtain them -- and if US patent law allows for the patenting of whatever your idea is.  Software, for instance, can only be copyrighted, which I think is insanity.  As for the "[[LiteSwitchX]], Watson, [[OmniWeb]], and [[CodeWarrior]]", those are all different apps, that have met w/ different fates.  [[LiteSwitchX]] is as dead as dead.  Watson is alive (kinda -- see above link), for the one reason that I've mentioned not once already; Sherlock is the rare case when Apple has done something that really stinks on ice.  [[CodeWarrior]] comes from what was another mega giant, Motorola, and the mother of Apple's chips for a long time.  Companies, academics and individuals have many years worth of code warrior projects and experience.  While [[XCode]] allows [[CodeWarrior]] Project imports, the issue is that of migration.  Try as you may, getting people to "switch" isn't easy.  [[OmniWeb]] I don't know about, but I will say that since the release of Safari, the number of mac users I know has all switched from other brosweres to Safari... some people keep a copy of Exploder or Napigator around "just in case".  Eudora for instance is almost dead, any calendar app that doesn't allow multiple people to edit the same calendar (e.g. [[CorporateTime]]) is dead, I haven't even SEEN a music player out there running on someone's mac since before OS X.  So, I not sure what your point was with those apps --  almost all of them, with the exception of cases were Apple either hasn't provided necessary funcitonality provided by other apps, or where Apple was up against another giant, or where Apple did something sucky, the apps have died.  Nor do I really understand what you mean by "free money".  Work was done, and Apple shouldn't get a ''free'' ride on someone else's coattails.  Why you ask, b/c as I've continuously said, if a developer creates something good enough to copy, it is in Apple's and the mac user base's (and obviously the developer's) interests to keep that developer around in case the developer comes up with more good ideas apple can copy (or, ''gasp'', that the developer can sell himself).
----
Patents are ''not'' supposed to protect ideas, they are supposed to protect research investments.

Example 1: I might get the ingenious idea to mix coffee and yoghurt to get a fresh new taste. Since everybody could have gotten that idea, and it was just a question of "being first", I should not have the right to patent it.

Example 2: I may spend 2 millions in research to manipulate my yoghurt product so that it doesn't go bad for the first 2 weeks. Since I spent a lot of money coming up with the process to synthesize an enzyme in order to achieve my goal, I would need a patent for this exact process -- this patent will only be given for a limited period of time, where I am supposed to earn back my investment, and the patent will only be for my ''specific'' process, i.e. it will ''not'' be for the idea of synthesizing enzymes, using enzymes with yoghurt, or creating yoghurt which doesn't go bad.  My competitors are free to come out with their own coffee-tasting yoghurt that doesn't go bad, given that they do not use the same process that I spent 2 millions to develop.

Software patents is much closer to example #1, and it's very hurtful for the industry, and very unfair for those who came late to the game, i.e. many of the things I could easily "invent" on my own was patented back when I was an infant, and if I lived in the US, I would actually be prevented from using many simple ideas in my programming.

For a scary reality check, see: http://webshop.ffii.org/ this shows at least 20 ''european'' patents which are all ''granted'', that someone would infringe on, if that someone build the webshop in question -- this is absurd!

Also, please keep in mind if Apple must pay us (small software developers) for ideas they get from using our software, shouldn't we also pay them? we seriously rip them off like crazy all the time (at least the good software does)!

And speaking of 3rd party software, I use Proteus (registered) instead of iChat and I use [[OmniWeb]] (registered) instead of Safari -- I only use Xcode for a subset of my development tasks.  I also seriously doubt that [[SpotLight]] will take away my need for [[QuickSilver]] (which I use instead of [[LaunchBar]]).

With regard to Mail and iTunes, I ''would'' be using a 3rd party application if there was something better which also looked decent, but I have searched and searched, but still not found anything.

To me, programs like [[BBEdit]], [[CodeWarrior]], Eudora, [[WinIE]] etc. seems like stuff that died in the transition from Classic to OS X. I have never used Classic, so from my perspective these applications stink big time! They lack so many OS X features, have such crappy UI and just doesn't feel like "modern" OS X citizens, please do not blame their death on Apple.

And one last thing, remember that Apple does everything but try to crush the 3rd party developer, when they do something, they often accompany it with XML file formats, frameworks, or similar which allow 3rd party developers to interact with their new creation or use the fruit of their efforts.  Including releasing some as Open Source (or sending back patches to OSS projects they use).

You make many valid points, and I agree with you almost entirely.  Indeed, as I started this page off by saing that OS X is a developer's OS; Cocoa is inherently a ''developers'' technology, meant to make software pop up like a heat rash in July.  And indeed it has; no longer do I see academic apps using SIOUX (anyone remmeber those days?), but really GUI apps that are easy to use and do their job well (and quickly -- and for the most part those apps are stable, too, with few bugs resulting from the use and reuse of frameworks provided to us by Apple).  Apple does indeed make their file formats open, Keynote is a prime example, and provides fantastic [[APIs]] to their other Apps; [[AddressBook]] is a wonderful example.  Apple is by far the coolest computer company, with by far the best OS, and some pretty nice hardware too.  They are not, however, without flaw; especially Steve.  Steve wants to supress HD DVD which is an assult on consumers, and occasionally he does tread on third party developer toes, despite Apple's general philosophy of embracing their developer base -- no other company panders to its developers like Apple does.  The few cases when Apple does screw its developers over, deserve attention, though, despite Apple's overall willingness -- even eagerness to please its developer base.  Coming up with an idea requires free time; developing it requires more free time.  Free time costs money -- if I have free time, it's because I'm not working, and if I'm not working I'm not getting paid... in a way, I go into debt while coming up with and developing [[MyInsanelyGreatIdea]].  Sometimes, I, as the third party developer, actually do go into debt, living on credit cards, until those shareware checks come in and bail me out.  If Apple rips me, they are probably terminating my collection cycle prematurely, and I do not get compensated for my work.  I don't, frankly, see the devide between development and research; both cost money, and both require that the labor be compensated; they should be offered the same kinds of protection.  As for late comers; go ahead and cry me a river.  It's called marketshare, and if your marketspace has been absorbed, that's where your problem lies; not with patents.  OS/2, [[BeOS]], Warp, and others came late... and they left early.  Not because they had patent issues, not because some of them weren't good; [[BeOS]] was nice, but it never even got to gold master (unless you consider an OS that doesn't support printing to be at gold master)... why?  Many reasons, some of which actually have to do with Apple, but that's an asside.  They could not survive on their own because their market space had been eaten up by MS... and 5% by Apple.
----
''I don't, frankly, see the devide between development and research; both cost money, and both require that the labor be compensated; they should be offered the same kinds of protection.''

Development: If you spend 500 hours implementing your insanely great idea, it is assumed that your competitor would likewise have to spend 500 hours implementing that same idea, otherwise you are not cost-effective, and thus you should re-think your business (like paying someone else to implement your ideas).  In this scenario you'll always be 500 hours in front of your competitor (if all he does is rip off your ideas), and thus you should be in a position to compete, even though he is ripping you off (the marked is not ideal, I agree to that, but this is the theory).

Research: If you spend 500 hours coming up with a solution to how it will be possible to implement your insanely great idea, your competitor will get a free ride on your research, since he can just see how you did it, and do the same. This is where patents come into play, although 500 hours of research is IMHO not enough to justify exclusive rights to the idea for 10 or more years -- and also, the patent should relate to the exact process you came up with, because it might be that your competitor can think of a different way to implement it in much less time (and shouldn't he then be allowed to do so, as he is clearly smarter than you, if he can, and that just raises the bar further, which benefits everyone but you).

In normal engineering I think these things make sense, but with software it's a bit different, because there is no physical process involved in the research -- did [[UniSys]] really spend millions on developing the LZW compression (used in GIF) and was it really that non-obvious that they should get their 20 years patent on the algorithm? Or was it just a natural extension of LZ77 which any programmer could have come up with given a months worth of time?

Worse is probably the RLE patent which affects the JPEG format (but unlike [[UniSys]], the patentor decided not to enforce it).

This however is probably a bit off topic for the "Apple ripping of people"-discussion, since this has little to do with software patents and instead relate to design patents (at least I would think so). But probably none of the products Apple took ideas from could have gotten one, because the program was already infringing on Apple's design patents ;)

''As for late comers; go ahead and cry me a river.  It's called marketshare,''

If this is in reply to what I wrote, I think you misunderstood me. I was talking about being a late-comer to the "patents up for grab"-business.  Just check this recent article from EFF: http://www.eff.org/patent/wanted/

''OS/2, [[BeOS]], Warp, and others came late... and they left early.  Not because they had patent issues''

Actually, some of their "problems" have been Microsoft not playing fair, like putting in the NDA for Win95 development that any signer of such an NDA (and thus participation in the beta program, required by most software houses) was not permitted to develop software for competing systems (like OS/2) � and the economic sanctions they have put upon OEM who want to ship systems which could dual boot etc.

I don't think Spotlight is the same as launchBar. I use LB as an app launcher. With two letters, it finds the exact app I'm looking for 90% of the time and for the 10% left, these are apps for which I prefer to use the same two letters. I don't use LB for searching (although you could use it for that) and that's what Spotlight is for. I'll still buy LB in the future.

I tried Tiger for an hours or so and I didn't really like how Spotlight worked, I hope this will be improved. I missed the full path view of a search result in a Panther's window.

On the Dashboard/Konfabulator ripoff or not subject, I'd recommend to read this http://daringfireball.net/2004/06/dashboard_vs_konfabulator
This match what I think on the subject.
As for me, I'm glad Apple made it, I didn't like the fact that konfab widgets stayed on my desktop all the time and I'm sure that the use of Webkit to make widgets will help the creation of lots of nice things. 
----
People don't seem to be understanding the point Apple's critics are trying to drive home. The point is not that developers should have some unlimited exclusive license to their ideas, and no other developer is ever allowed to challenge them. The point is that Apple is not just some other developer. Apple is the creator of the OS, and as such they have powers that none of us will ever have. Along with this, they have a responsibility to be very careful not to use their power unfairly. Where were all of these free-market thinkers when Microsoft was using that same power to drive out Netscape?

''I have been hating Microsoft since '93 or so, but initially I was on their side in the Netscape controversy -- if Microsoft can create something better (at that time, both browsers really sucked) then they should certainly do so!''

''Later I have learned two things, 1) the actual tactics used by Microsoft to win the browser war and 2) that certain rules apply to a monopoly, namely that a monopoly may not be used to gain a new monopoly, i.e. Microsoft is, by law, not allowed to use their monopoly as OS vendor to gain an unfair advantage into the browser market.''

Precisely. Apple has a big monopoly in the Mac OS market, and they can do the same thing to third-party Mac developers that Microsoft did to Netscape. That's the point I was trying to make. By ripping off Konfabulator or whatever it is you want to say they ripped off and integrating it into the OS (as Microsoft did with Explorer), they can completely decimate the market for other parties' software in that field. They are not like any other competitor.

''One, they didn't rip off Konfabulator or anything else. Two, even if they did, the fact that they have a Mac monopoly is irrelevant. Microsoft doesn't get criticized because they have a monopoly on Windows, they get criticized because they have a monopoly on desktop operating systems in general. That has never been true of Apple.''
----
While Dashboard may seem to be a ripoff of Konfabulator, Konfabulator is a ripoff of [[DesktopX]] for Windows (see Stardock). So while Konfabulator is crying "no fair", they're not blameless either.

''Stardock's product manager doesn't seem to see it that way.'' http://tinyurl.com/2w9os ''Draginol is the guy from Stardock.''

I would like to add that if this were MS I would be a lot less upset; that's just the way MS is.  Apple likes to convince people that it's cool and not like MS.  What hurts so much about this, aside from the fact that it's destroying the few [[ISVs]] out there, is that Apple is behaving like MS... and it's tearing me up inside.
----
I thought this was kinda funny:  http://nytimes.com/2004/07/08/technology/circuits/08stat.html?pagewanted=1  (soul sucking registration required).  The summary: how MS loves to rip people off, and how it's set its rip off sights on google.  Why is the relevant to the above discussion?  Becuase a large part of the discussion focused on the abstract notion of copying ideas, irrespective of who is doing the copying, and that's partially what that news link explores.

''I will also disagree with all those who say that when a developer releases a good product with a nice UI, they have "ripped" apple's UI design paradigms.  They haven't.  If you've read the Aqua guidelines you know that Apple '''wants''' developers to produce software that has a common "look and feel".  Developers who create aqualicious [[GUIs]] are not ripping Apple they are being good developers and adhering the guidelines set forth by Apple.''

'''Take something like Proteus, a lot of features were added after the release of iChat which are not in the AHIG, and the recent version has a clone of Safari's download window, which again is not in the AHIG.'''

'''You can't blame Apple for doing what everybody else already do, that it may benefit Apple (as long os the 3rd party developers stay on their platform) is really besides the point.'''
