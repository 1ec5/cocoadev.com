Completely new to Cocoa.  Eager to learn.

*Welcome to the site. No offense, but one thing to learn is how to delete pages. Instead of editing the General/RecentChanges page, you add this line to your page: \\%\\%BEGINENTRY\\%\\%General/DeleteMe - some reason\\%\\%ENDENTRY\\%\\%. (Feel free to delete this text after you read it). Good luck with Cocoa - Macs rule!*
