Hi all. I'm mostly a Java developer by trade these days at www.osafoundation.org, but I like to dabble in Cocoa.

My current Cocoa project is an attempt to write have our sharing server (Cosmo) sync with Apple's [[SyncServices]]. 

I'm writing it in Objective-c and using (er, trying to use) the Java-Cocoa Bridge to call Java library code from Objective-C classes.
