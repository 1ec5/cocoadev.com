I currently work as a C++ programmer, writing a unix GUI (using Qt) for a program called [[WorkPace]].  We're gradually porting it over to unix from Windows, and eventually to [[MacOS]] X and perhaps classic.  It keeps me busy, most of the time...

...but for the times I'm not busy, I try to go to university and study a bit on my computer science degree.  The time I spend getting anything done in that part of my life is getting smaller though, and the gaps between those times getting larger. :)

I got my first Mac late last year.  I somehow managed to swap my aging PC for an  iMac, because I was sick to death of more or less everything to do with [[PCs]].  Now I spend all day working on the [[PCs]] and unix machines even more obscure, but at least I have a lovely Mac to come home to.

I'm entirely curious about Objective C and Cocoa, I've had a hack around with it but nothing too serious.  What I've seen I really really like.  I want my first project to be a decent game, but I can't work out what I should use to thrash Cocoa into providing 2D graphics as fast as I want them.  Anyone here is welcome to help... I'll put up what I know when I get a chance.

But now it's off to get some more of that bothersome university work done...

Have you considered using [[OpenGL]]? There's no problem doing 2D work in it, and it's about as fast as you can get. -- [[RobRix]]
