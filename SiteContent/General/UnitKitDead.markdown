Hello,

I installed [[UnitKit]] a long time ago for a small hobby project and I really liked it.  I've recently resumed my project and continues using [[UnitKit]], but it seems that http://unitkit.org is unavailable and has been for some time.  I've been in tough with the [[UnitKit]] author earlier, but he hasn't responded to my e-mail.  Is [[UnitKit]] still actively maintained or has development stopped?

What do you guys use for unit testing?  I really like [[UnitKit]] 2.0's tight integration with Xcode and Growl.  Thanks.

It's not dead.  It's merely resting.

Indeed, I found it resting at <http://web.archive.org/web/20050317031046/http://unitkit.org/>.

...but the downloadable files are corrupt; won't open with hdiutil.
