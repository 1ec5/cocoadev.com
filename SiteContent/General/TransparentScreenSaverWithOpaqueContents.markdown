I'd like to have my screensaver draw a transparent background, but with the contents that I draw myself showing opaque (non-transparent.) Is there any way to accomplish this?

All the [[TransparentScreenSaver]] code I've seen uses <code>[[self window] setAlphaValue:alphaValue]</code> which causes '''everything''' to be drawn with alpha. I know this is possible in a normal [[NSView]], but all my attempts to do it in a [[ScreenSaverView]] result in a opaque black background.
