 

Graphic designer. English.

Recently bought a G5 and thought for that sort of money I want to be able to use everything it comes with, including General/XCode :).

Never programmed in anything but BBC BASIC before (showing my age here), but I've found Stephen Kochan's book General/BookProgInObjC hugely helpful in starting to learn the language: and there's plenty of meat in there to keep me going for some time to come.

Also been using the Apple recommended General/BookLearningCocoaObjCSecond to begin GUI programming. Rather disappointed at what it doesn't cover but beginning to understand that any one book can only be an introduction - you'd need a whole library of books to cover all the classes in Cocoa, but it's absolutely amazing what can be achieved with just tiny bits of code.

The General/CocoaBrowser mentioned at the end of the book is absolutely fantastic: makes those huge developer-doc html pages actually readable!
