I write software exclusively for Mac OS X, using Cocoa and Ruby. I am particularly interesting in custom view development and have made several of my own controls open-source. I also maintain an open-source framework called Amber hosted at http://code.google.com/p/amber-framework which contains useful [[ObjcCategories]] and all the user interface widgets. It has a handful of handy drawing methods and is used by my controls you might be interested in too.

My directory website is hosted at http://33software.com and my blog at http://33software.com/blog

The following controls are open-sourced, if you use them I'd appreciate you contributing any changes back. If you notice any issues with my controls please report them on the respective Google Code issues tab.

* [[SourceList]]; the view I am most proud of, it's completely custom [[NSView]] subclass which draws a source list like the ones found in the iLife apps.
* [[CalendarControl]]; a calendar much like the one found in Leopard's iCal and the iPhone. Written specifically for my upcoming application.
* [[WeekControl]], a subproject of [[CalendarControl]]; it provides a tidier way of representing the weekdays without having to use seven separate checkboxes
* [[SwitchControl]]; a 'big button' control like the one found in [[TimeMachine]].prefPane and Server Preferences. This too was written for my upcoming application.
* [[ActivationControl]]; my latest control (still in eary development) imitating the [[AppleTV]] and Remote.app authorization interface.
