I write software exclusively for Mac OS X, using Cocoa and Ruby. I am particularly interesting in custom view development and have made several of my own controls open-source. I also maintain an open-source framework called Amber hosted at http://code.google.com/p/amber-framework which contains useful General/ObjcCategories and all the user interface widgets. It has a handful of handy drawing methods and is used by my controls you might be interested in too.

My directory website is hosted at http://33software.com and my blog at http://33software.com/blog

The following controls are open-sourced, if you use them I'd appreciate you contributing any changes back. If you notice any issues with my controls please report them on the respective Google Code issues tab.

* General/SourceList; the view I am most proud of, it's completely custom General/NSView subclass which draws a source list like the ones found in the iLife apps.
* General/CalendarControl; a calendar much like the one found in Leopard's iCal and the iPhone. Written specifically for my upcoming application.
* General/WeekControl, a subproject of General/CalendarControl; it provides a tidier way of representing the weekdays without having to use seven separate checkboxes
* General/SwitchControl; a 'big button' control like the one found in General/TimeMachine.prefPane and Server Preferences. This too was written for my upcoming application.
* General/ActivationControl; my latest control (still in eary development) imitating the General/AppleTV and Remote.app authorization interface.
