A personal Wiki... includes [[FScript]] support, and a [[DOScriptingArchitecture]] interface (see Contents/Resources/[[DOSAInfo]].html) requires the [[FScript]] framework installed in Library/Frameworks...

Any thoughts?

Definitely has potential. May I humbly suggest adding the question mark next to [[PagesThatDontExist]]? Also, have you seen [[VoodooPad]] (http://flyingmeat.com/voodoopad.html)? I used [[VoodooPad]] a lot back when it was free. Keep up the good work! --[[RobinHP]]

[[WikiPad]] is already a name in use: http://www.jera.com/wikipad/
[[VoodooPad]] Lite is still free: http://www.flyingmeat.com/voodoopadlite.html

How does it uh... save data? Other than that, I guess [[WikiPad]] is a start :)

I didn't know about that [[WikiPad]]... hmmm... thanks, oh, and yes it does save automatically and transparently to user defaults.  With regards to the ? for pages that don't exist... I actually prefer it to be underlined, but I may make it check if that page exists and change the colour of the underline.  The real plan is to open source the app... soon.  I'll post back here after that.

I would suggest including the [[FScript]] Library in the distribution, good start, have a look at http://blog.scheirich.info/[[PersonalWiki]] not as easy to use as [[VoodooPad]] but connect to [[ZWiki]] and Wikis that do XML-RPC, [[HaRald]]
