I'm a recent graduate of the Universit� d'Orl�ans with a Master of Computer Science, and I did my undergraduate degree, also CS, at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. I am currently Employee #004 for [[RogueAmoeba]].

I've been programming in various ways on various platforms for a bit less than two decades. I've been using Objective-C since around 2000, and programming with Cocoa on OS X since 10.1 or so. My programming interests include (but are not limited to!) artificial life, robotics, and distributed computing.

My master's thesis ties together distributed computing, real-time simulation, and 3D graphics, describing my project to create a real-time 3D fluid simulation and renderer running on a cluster.

Open source software I've made with pages on this site:

* '''[[MAKeyedArchiver]]''' - A drop-in replacement for [[NSKeyedArchiver]] and [[NSKeyedUnarchiver]]. It uses identical [[APIs]] but is typically five times faster and produces archives that are half the size.
* '''[[CHOMp]]''' - An extensible, clean [[HigherOrderMessaging]] implementation.
* '''[[AEVTBuilder]]''' - A library for building [[AppleEvents]] with a simple syntax that maps easily to/from [[AppleEvent]] dumps.


More open source software, mostly Cocoa, in various stages of completion can be found in my svn repository: http://www.mikeash.com/svn/
