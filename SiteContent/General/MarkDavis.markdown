I'm a freshman commerce student at Saint Mary's University in Halifax. I run a web/mac design/development company called Colovo. I'm into Mac computers (of course), acoustic/electric guitar, vegetarian living, and user interface design. I've developed over a dozen applications for Mac OS X to date, and will keep on coding until the ideas stop flowing.

Please ignore the - in Sociali-st, [[CocoaDev]] will not allow me to enter the correct name (because it contains the word cial''s in it)
