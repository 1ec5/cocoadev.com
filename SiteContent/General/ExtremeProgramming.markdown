I *believe* that General/ExtremeProgramming has to do with taking your General/PowerBook rock-climbing. Or maybe it should be called General/EffectiveProgramming instead :) -- General/RobRix

See http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?General/ExtremeProgramming.  The General/PortlandPatternRepository is where most discussion regarding XP, as it is called, takes place.  General/KentBeck and General/RonJeffries, while working on General/ChryslerComprehensiveCompensation(or C3), invented this particular methodology.  General/ExtremeProgramming emphasises:


*General/UnitTest
*General/ReFactoring
*General/YouArentGonnaNeedIt
*General/OnceAndOnlyOnce
*General/OptimizeLater
*General/ContinuousIntegration
*General/TheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork
