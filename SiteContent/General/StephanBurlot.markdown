Current Cocoa projects:


* [[PiX]] - Calculate PI with a jillion decimals.
* [[WakeUp]] - Wakes up your machines remotely by sending them a network packet.
* [[SafariFix]] - Quick hack to solve a vulnerability in [[MacOSX]]. Since Unsanity released Paranoid Android, and since Apple did release a fix, this is useless. Code is available, though, if you want to know how to install a handler for a specific protocol.
* [[SafariBookmarkChecker]] - checks the validity of safari bookmarks really fast using parallel threads.
