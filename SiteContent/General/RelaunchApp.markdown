What is the best way to relaunch my app programmatically? Can it be done through running an applescript and then terminating and the applescript waits a couple seconds and launches my app again, or does the applescript go down with the ship? Any proven methods that work for you people?

I have written some code to perform this task. Have a look at this blog entry: http://0xced.blogspot.com/2006/06/relaunch-your-cocoa-application-by.html (Relaunch your Cocoa application by itself)
Note that this is what is used by [[SparkleUpdater]].

Haven't tried it, but one idea could be to put a flag somewhere in the code (haven't figured out where) that says whether or not the application really terminated. Then you can do a fake termination by calling <code>[[[NSApp]] terminate]</code>, and rewrite your main method like this. WARNING: UNTESTED! --[[JediKnil]]
<code>
static BOOL shouldKeepGoing = YES;

int main(int argc, const char ''argv[])
{
    int returnCode = 0;
    while (shouldKeepGoing) {
        shouldKeepGoing = NO;
        // Set it to YES somewhere in your code to restart the program.
        returnCode = [[NSApplicationMain]](argc, argv);
    }
    return returnCode;
}
</code>

What if your app were to choke and croak? How could you relaunch after a crash? Is that doable? -- [[JasonTerhorst]]

How I do this is my program calls a simple Cocoa tool (command line app) that quits the program, and then launches it, and then that program finishes nomrally. I just use [[NSFileManager]]'s openFile to open the app. And since my app is a little helper app, it is located inside the Resources folder, so it knows how to access the main program's path.

Take a look at the <code>[[LSOpenFromURLSpec]]</code> function. You pass it a <code>[[LSLaunchURLSpec]]</code>, which has a <code>launchFlags</code> field in which you can specify <code>kLSLaunchNewInstance</code> which will cause it to launch a new copy of an app that's already running. Basically, (1) call [[LSOpenFromURLSpec]] and pass a file URL to your <code>[[[[NSBundle]] mainBundle] bundlePath]</code>, then (2) call <code>[[[NSApp]] terminate:nil]</code> to kill the current instance of your application.

Updated with code:

<code>
#include <[[ApplicationServices]]/[[ApplicationServices]].h>

...

NSURL ''url = [NSURL fileURLWithPath:[[[[NSBundle]] mainBundle] bundlePath]];

[[LSLaunchURLSpec]] launchSpec;
launchSpec.appURL = ([[CFURLRef]])url;
launchSpec.itemURLs = NULL;
launchSpec.passThruParams = NULL;
launchSpec.launchFlags = kLSLaunchDefaults | kLSLaunchNewInstance;
launchSpec.asyncRefCon = NULL;

[[OSErr]] err = [[LSOpenFromURLSpec]](&launchSpec, NULL);
if (err == noErr) {
    [[[NSApp]] terminate:nil];
} else {
    // Handle relaunch failure
}
</code>

If you want to be able to detect a crash and relaunch after that, though, you need to have another program running that spawns the app and either polls every X seconds to make sure it's still running, or waits for a notification of its termination and relaunches it.

I tend to go with the applescript app method.  I have a small applescript application bundle (must be bundle, simply having an app causes Classic to launch on my machine for some reason) inside the resources folder.  I then use [[NSWorkspace]]'s launchApp: to launch it.  The applescript is really simple:

<code>
tell app "x"
    quit
    delay 1
    activate
end tell
</code>

You can catch crashes inside your app by using "signal(SIGILL, handleCrash)" where handleCrash is the name of a normal C-style function.  The function will take one parameter that is the type of crash that occurred.  You'll have to register for several signals.  A list of them can be found in /usr/include/sys/signal.h.  I'd, however, hate to have an app relaunch after a crash, especially since the crash reporter will offer to relaunch an application for you on Tiger.

----
Note that restarting your app from a signal handler is really hard to do correctly, see [[SignalSafety]]. It may work correctly a large part of the time, but it will crash and burn or freeze at least some of the time, which will significantly worsen the experience. If you want to catch a crash, it's much better to have an external process the way Apple and various third-party crash catchers do it.
