Not that anyone cares...

I worked for a music software company from 1990-2000 programming a 16-bit Windows app in Pascal. Boy, does that look great on my resume.

After that, I did an eight-month stint as a Java programmer for a start-up in San Francisco that had lots of money and no roadmap for a product. After that crashed and burned I took a job in tech support for a music software company out of desperation. I quit after getting dangerously close to losing the will to live. Ten months of unemployment later, they called and offered me a four-month gig doing QA on new versions. Hey, it's not programming but it beats the heck out of tech support. Plus it's an all-Mac company and I get to work from home.

So now I'm learning Objective-C and Cocoa in the hopes that I may be lucky enough to either find someone who wants an inexperienced Cocoa programmer who works from home or else have a brainstorm for a killer app that will generate enough income that I don't have to get a real job. I'm also doing it because it's fun.

Also fun: playing in a band called The Universal Steve http://theuniversalsteve.com, singing in two choirs, drinking Martinis with my wife and watching Heros.

''2008 update:'' I got a job at a physics lab that's doing research on fusion energy. They hired me as a programmer to write visualization software that interfaces with their physics simulation program to make the experimentation process more efficient. The best part is that we're working in OS X so my software is all Cocoa-based!

Now as 2009 draws to a close I've written a few more programs. Some even required Calculus!

As 2010 ends I still work for the same company. I've continued writing Mac software and have even gotten a couple of my Cocoa programs to run under Windows (for my co-workers on that platform) using The Cocotron (http://www.cocotron.org). I've been writing a lot of software in Igor Pro (http://www.wavemetrics.com) to automate experiments and collect, graph, and analyze data.
