I am currently reading General/BookProgInObjC and I am enjoying it very much. The author, General/StephenKochan, teaches General/ObjectiveC and C at the same time. He doesn't assume that one knows C, and I like this fact a lot. It makes the book a very easy read. As of today (05 Sep 2005), I am just finishing the exercises at the end of chapter 3.
