[[AppleComputer]]'s (formerly [[NeXT]]'s) [[WebObjects]] frameworks, are basically, a set of frameworks building on the [[FoundationKit]], for making web applications. An example of this is [[AppleComputer]]'s own Apple Store, which is run by means of a [[WebObjects]] application (or was last I saw).

[[WebObjects]] 5 was just released, and the deployment platform is Java and therefore should work on any JRE1.3 platform! Yay! However, I quote:
(1) [[WebObjects]] 5 is officially qualified for use only on Mac OS X, Windows 2000 Pro, and Solaris 8 using Oracle 8i with JDBC 2 and the Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition 1.3. 
Although I guess linux might work :)

Unfortunately, WO is pay-for software. Currently, the price is $699 (originally, it was $50,000 for an unlimited-user license!!!).

''Paying ADC members get a free development license.''

See http://www.apple.com/webobjects/ for more information.

The SOPE application server which is part of [[OpenGroupware]].org includes an almost complete implementation of the [[WebObjects]] 4.5.1 framework under the LGPL license, that is, an Objective-C implementation of WO.

See http://www.opengroupware.org/en/devs/sope/ for more information.  ''Looks like it needs a LOT more info on the site, etc. to make people feel comfy. ;-) ''

[[GNUstepWeb]] is written in Objective-C and designed to be source-code compatible with [[WebObjects]] 4.5.

See http://wiki.gnustep.org/index.php/[[GNUstepWeb]]

A somewhat dated (Mar. 2008) port of [[GNUstepWeb]] and GDL2 ([[EnterpriseObjectsFramework]] clone) for Mac OS 10.5 may be found here:  http://freshmeat.net/projects/gdgswebforosx

[[WebObjects]] is now free for everyone to use and is included with the Xcode 2.1 Developer Tools.

Sure that applies to deployment as well?

[[WebObjects]] deployment is free with OS X Server, but the [[XCode]] Tools don't include a deployment licence.
