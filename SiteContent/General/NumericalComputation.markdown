If you want to use your G4/G5 with Mac OS X for some good  numerical work .. this could be useful to you. I have here, binaries, source, documentation and instructions to install Fortran, MPI, General/OpenMP, Octave, Cactus, Globus, RNPL, GIMPS, Computing Libraries, Pascal, LISP, GRAVSIM, FEYNMAN, etc. on Darwin OS.

Speaking from personal experience, Octave is really, really cool. I'm rather fond of General/NumericalComputation also.

-- General/RobRix

There is an octave wiki page at http://omni.isr.ist.utl.pt/~etienne/cgi-bin-etienne/wiki.pl , with the beginnings of a General/MacOSX section http://omni.isr.ist.utl.pt/~etienne/cgi-bin-etienne/wiki.pl?General/OctaveForMac

There are still parts of octave/octave-forge that need porting.

-- General/PerSquare

Eigenmath:  http://eigenhead.com/ is a nice little symbolic math tool.  Seems to be easy to use also!
