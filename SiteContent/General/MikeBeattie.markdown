Mike Beattie is a Computer Engineering student at Carnegie Mellon University.


Basically, I've been a [[MacGuy]](tm) for as long as I've owned my own computer. I've been trying to do some work with Cocoa on and off as I find myself having time (which hasn't happened in just about 6 months now). I'm very fond of web-based communities like this and am very impressed by [[WikiWikiWeb]], so I thought I'd put my name on this list. I'd love to contribute, and maybe this first step will inspire me to do so (although having some knowledge to contribute will have to come first).

Anyway, for a less on-task web community, take a look at:

Hope to see this site develop into something truly useful! As far as I can tell, it's off to a great start.
