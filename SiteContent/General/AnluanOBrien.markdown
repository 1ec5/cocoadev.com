Toronto Based Cocoa Developer

Currently working on:

*iStrip - comic strip reader (yes there are others out there).
*iChm - an attempt to create a Microsoft Help File reader for macs. Stalled on the chm format right now.
* Some unnamed projects to tinker with in my free time.


Past Projects:

*General/MacTitrax - a cocoa port of the old Titrax (nee timetracker) on UNIX. Currently undergoing some changes.


My day job is slinging Java, C and Cocoa in and around Toronto.
