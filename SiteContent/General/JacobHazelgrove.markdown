Awesome ideas. I'd soo love to see tear off menus... Probably by a haxie :)

Well the tear off menus, at this stage are going to be written specifically for an application, but I have high hopes for the future.

Cool, I've been bugging Unsanity for a while bout this.

''Make sure you bug Apple too.''

Tear off menus were lost because OS X uses Carbon functions to draw menus, not the original Cocoa methods.
