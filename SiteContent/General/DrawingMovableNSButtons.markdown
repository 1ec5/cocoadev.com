Hi.  I was wondering how to draw objects such as General/NSButtons in General/NSCustomViews so that the objects can be moved around freely by the user.  I also would like to know if there is a way to keep track of them all.

*You could look at General/SaileshAgrawal's General/DragMatrix class, or General/UliKusterer's General/UKDistributedView class, both of which could work for your purposes.*
