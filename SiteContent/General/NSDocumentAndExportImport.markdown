If you're using General/NSDocument and you want to support exporting and importing of files, you will want to have a closer look at the General/CFBundleTypeRole key in the Info.plist and the General/NSExportableAs key. Both are described on the Wiki page for General/CFBundleTypeRole for now. Just thought I'd add this page to make sure people find this, because I certainly didn't look there.
