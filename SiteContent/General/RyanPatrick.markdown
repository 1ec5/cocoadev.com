Been coding with Cocoa/ Obj-C for about a year.  I have a couple years experience with Java and a number of different web-based scripting languages.  I am currently working for a non-profit cancer research institute developing web-based applications and a large Cocoa application.  

I live in Seattle and work so that I can play soccer at night/weekends :)
