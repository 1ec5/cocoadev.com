An General/NSMovieView displays an General/NSMovie (a wrapper for a General/QuickTime movie) in a frame and provides methods for playing and editing the movie.

**Important**: General/NSMovieView is obsolete and should not be used for new development. If you are developing for 10.4+, or 10.3 with General/QuickTime 7 installed, use General/QTMovieView.
