I currently live in Ohio, and I am 17 years old. I started programming when I was nine (in C, which was a mistake). After forgetting about learning C, I moved on to worse things... [[REALBasic]]. Looking back on those days, I just want to puke. I actually made a program that people ''bought''. Scary, huh?

Anyway, at around 13 I began to slowly pick up C++ again. Once I finished by RB "program" (if you could even call it that), I realized that I needed some way to create a good Mac application in C++. So I blew $50 and bought Carbon Programming (at the time, the only Cocoa book on the market was Learning Cocoa by O'reilly, which was another $35 down the tube). I got through about half of this Carbon book before realizing how uneccissarily complex (and outdated) the book was, not the metion the announcement by Steve that Mac OS 9 was "dead to developers".

So I decided to pick up Cocoa. I went out and bought Cocoa Programming for Mac OS X, and later Cocoa Programming (by Anguish et al). I am happy to say that I am currently working on two projects, both in Cocoa, one with a friend who is doing a Windoze version in VB (which is really hard to coexist with, IMO). As most people, I am still learning a lot about the Cocoa framework and [[ObjC]] language every time I open [[ProjectBuilder]] (and Cocoa Programming, and Cocoa Browser... ;-) ).

Anyway, that's a little of my programming life history. Now I know ten programming languages: C, C++, Obj-C, Cocoa, HTML, XML, Perl, PHP, Visual Basic, [[REALBasic]], and a little Carbon (but not enough to say that I know it as a full programming language). Nothing I'm not proud of, of course :-D.

'''How to Contact Me'''

If you need to contact me for whatever reason, my e-mail address is macfreak2000 AT hotmail DOT com. No spam!! Also, if it is ''really really really really'' important that you contact me immedietely (although I can't think of a good reason off the top of my head ;-) ), my AIM s/n is mac1marc.

My company's homepage is: http://www.northsoftproductions.com/ even though this is kind irrelevant now. We decided to fold the company around the middle of March this year (2004) due to lack of interest and productivity. We are all in high school and no one had the time to spare needed to keep the company up. Oh well, that just means more time for open source projects! :-) (oh yeah... and, um, school work... yeah.... schoolwork... uh huh. ;-) ).

'''UPDATE:''' oops, bye bye northsoft. after more than a year of absolute nothingness, we finally decided to call it quits...officially. the implied idea never really settled well so we had a 10 minute phone conversation discussing it. we all were ready to be rid of it, really. oh well.

Sorry, no blog. No time to keep up with one, and the idea of keeping a publically accessible online journal kinda freaks me out. Talk about the voluntary end to privacy! (not to insult anyone who does keep a blog, for whatever reason ;-) ).

''Update 11/20/03:'' I've now learned by 11th programming language, C#. Yeah yeah, I know it's a horrible Windows language and Cocoa absolutely dwarfs it by many multitudes, but hey, I need to port some of my Mac software to Windows, and the Windows programmers I know don't want to give up VB.NET (which they just learned, for some odd reason) for C#, even though it is worlds better. So yeah, now I know that too... and I still like Cocoa + [[XCode]] better than anything Micro$oft can put out. Don't worry. There won't be any conversions over to the Dark Side for me.

''Update 7/24/04:'' Woo I'm no longer 16 anymore! Happy bday to me. :)
