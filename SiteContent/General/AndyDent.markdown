Software developer in Perth, Western Australia with a very very wide range of interests (and about 20 years experience as of August 2002). 


No, this isn't intended to be a giant commercial (a lot of these tools are [[OpenSource]]). 



(Deep breath) Core interests in software: 

''	User interface design and usability http://www.oofile.com.au/adsother/[[UIDesign]].html 
''	Cross-platform development (especially Mac to Windows/Unix) http://www.oofile.com.au/crossplat.html 
''	Database application development tools and putting usable C++ API's on top of ISAM engines like Faircom's c-tree Plus http://www.oofile.com.au/databasedev.html 
''	Information presentation, especially printing and reporting http://www.oofile.com.au/reportwriter.html 
''	Code generation (worked on [[AppMaker]] and Marksman nee Prototyper) 
''	[[AgileProcesses]] - I started work on processes like my Diary-Driven Development in the early nineties http://www.oofile.com.au/adsother/[[SoftwareEngineeringIdeas]].html 
''	XML tools including the expatpp wrapper http://www.oofile.com.au/xml.html 
''	[[PythonLang]] (I've got religion!)

The more human side - I have two children from my first marriage, enjoy Ice Dancing, Scuba Diving and have been practising Chinese Martial Arts for most of my adult life. 



I am also very interested in Solar House design, and we're currently having a house built to our design. I will eventually have pages posted showing the progress of the design process - we spent about 8 months refining it.
