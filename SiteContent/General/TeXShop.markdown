[[TeXShop]] is a cocoa text editor and front end to the [[LaTeX]] macros for Knuth's [[TeX]] publishing system.

"[[TeXShop]] is a [[TeX]] previewer and editor for Mac OS X, written in Cocoa. Since PDF is a native file format on OS X, [[TeXShop]] uses "pdftex" and "pdflatex" rather than "tex" and "latex" to typeset".

The primary authors are Richard Koch, Max Horn and Dirk Olmes: The help of Many Others is acknowledged. Until recently, [[TeXShop]] users were advised to use Gerben Wierda's  i-Installer to the install the [[TeX]] machinery which does the actual typesetting, but from January 2007, the reccomendation has been [[MacTeX]]-2007 .
