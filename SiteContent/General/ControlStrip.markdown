A utility that shipped with General/MacOS 7.5 - General/MacOS 9. Well, it actually shipped first with 7.1, but only for General/PowerBooks. It displayed a hideable, collapsible floating window which could host various little thingies which performed useful or semi-useful tasks. Changing the system volume, launching apps, opening/closing a PPP connection (remember, this is the System 7 era) or turning file sharing on/off were common uses. Writing a Control Strip Module (CSM) was a standard beginner's Mac programming project 'back in the day'. Now largely replaced by Docklings (remember them?), Dashboard Widgets (starting in 10.4), General/NSMenuExtra (if you're Apple), or General/NSStatusItem (if you're not.)

An abandoned Carbon OSX port is at [http://www.strout.net/info/coding/macdev/openstrip/]
