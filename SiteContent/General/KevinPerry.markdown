OK, after months of lurking and even posting anonymously, I've decided to finally create my profile. Here goes...

My name is Kevin Perry and I'm currently a CS major Freshman at Brigham Young University. I'm originnaly from Kirkland/Bothell in the Seattle, WA area. I'm currently rather bored in my class learning basic Java, but it'll be over in December, then on to assemly! Hooray...

I first got interested in programming when I was about 15, but I didn't really have much internet access then, didn't know where to begin, etc. so I didn't have much of an opportunity to learn. However, my junior year in high school, I started taking classes at my local community college and took the two introductory CS classes that were given there, which started me out with C++. This was just around the time that I got a DSL at home, bought my iBook, and got the Mac OS X Public Beta, so all the tools necessary to begin were at my disposal.

From that point, it's fairly obvious that I'd become interested in Cocoa due to Mac OS X gaining popularity (and the fact that I was learning C++...) so I searched first for tutorials online, read Apple's PDF books, bought Hillegass's "Cocoa Programming for Mac OS X", and just recently Anguish's, Buck's and Yacktman's "Cocoa Programming" (Hey! I forgot to mention I live just 4 miles south of Yacktman, and I go to the same college he did!).

My school being a mostly Linux school, (at least on the teaching side) I think I have a pretty fair chance of demonsrating OSX and Cocoa to people, so wish me luck!

Lastly, please be patient with me as I make stupid comments and malformed code... I'm still learning :-)

Great news! I've chosen to go on a two-year full time mission for my church (what will Cocoa be like after I get home from THAT!) and I got my call today to Ukraine! Wish me luck all, and after July 16th, 2003 I'll see you in 2 years!

**Good luck! -- General/AngelaBrett**

It's official folks: I've now been made a missionary (see above) and will not be doing any programming work for the next two years. Heck, I won't be using a computer for more than email in that entire time. Good luck all, and I expect to be able to see all the great accomplishments you have all made when I get back in 2005!  As they say in Ukraine, dopobachennya! -- General/KevinPerry, signing off.

Hey! I'm back from my two years in Ukraine, and now I have the wonderful pleasure of relearning everything about computers and programming on my new General/PowerBook. :-) Wish me luck!

**Good luck! -- General/JoshaChapmanDodson**

Haha, maybe we should make General/CocoaLDSUsers!

What's BYU's CS program like, anyway?

BYU's CS program isn't the greatest in the world, but it does stick a little bit more to the theoretical/mathematical side of CS, yet still offers a decent amount of the more practical stuff that the other 95% of the CS graduates will use in their jobs everyday.

As a side note (perhaps I should make it a main point...), I forgot to mention that I'm currently doing an internship at Apple in the Cocoa Frameworks group! It's great to know and work with the guys behind most of the great frameworks that we use in OSX. It's especially nice because instead of just fetching coffee or what not, I get to get my hands dirty and work on enhancing and fixing the General/AppKit code in various ways. (It was a strange feeling at first to be compiling the entire General/AppKit on a daily basis...) I'm learning a ton and I hope that I'll be able to return next year!
