%%BEGINENTRY%%[[CocoaDevUsers]] - coming from the Unix world (BSD, Linux) - was interested in cocoadev with python so might look into [[PyObjC]]

?%%ENDENTRY%%

a mac newbie, came in for OSX, previous experience mostly from Linux .. some BSD and Solaris. a light user, not really a developer, yet at least. like to play around and study even deep (say, kernel) technologies too. oh and program audio with [[SuperCollider]] - that was actually the main reason for wanting a PPC.

workpage at http://www.tol.oulu.fi/~antont/ - something else at http://an.org

have been working with Blender, Pygame etc. recently - http://studio.kyperjokki.fi/engine/ a bit about that.

occasinally trying to get [[FenFire]] to work on mac, integrating that with cocoa & osx in general might be something
