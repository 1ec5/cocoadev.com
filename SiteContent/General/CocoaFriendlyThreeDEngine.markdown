Hi,

I would like to make some very simple 3D games, but I don't want to mess with collision detection,etc. I would like to use 3D engine that does most of the job for me ;). Are there any Cocoa friendly engines?

General/OpenGL is probably your best bet.

See General/CocoaOpenGL or search for General/OpenGL on General/CocoaDev and you will find quite a bit of information.
