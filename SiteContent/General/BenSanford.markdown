Beginning Cocoa programmer, although I've had quite a bit of experience with programming, about 3 years to be exact now.  Right now, I'm working on a full-featured Cocoa app that will encrypt/decrypt files (using a weak method, not really for critical files, but encrypted enough to confuse the heck out of snoopers).  It's actually a port of the program I made in C++, but it has much more user functionality.  I expect to be finished by the end of June 2004/beginning of July 2004.  Link will be up as soon as I'm done!
