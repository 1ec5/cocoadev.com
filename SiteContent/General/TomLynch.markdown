My name is Tom Lynch, I'm 22, from the UK, I started learning ASP then moved to PHP and General/MySQL which I am now qutie proficient in, I switched to a mac nearly 6 years ago and I am learning Cocoa with Aaron Hillgass's - Cocoa Programming for Mac OS X (2nd Ed), in my spare time. I also know xHTML and CSS.

My interest in programming and computers definitely came from my parents, mainly my dad who is a software engineer, working on software for IBM mainframe systems, and my mum who also worked in that area.

When I say I am learning its kind of a spare time thing, I really wish it was some thing I had more time for.

My setup.

iMac Intel
24" Display
4GB Ram
3.06ghz Intel Core 2 Duo
