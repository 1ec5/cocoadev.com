Hello Cocoa Developers!  I am in search of a Cocoa Developer for a Full time, Permanent position the Denver, Colorado Area.  There is a relocation package, and salary starts at $78k (without relevent industry experience) and is negotiable beyond that depending on industry experience.  Serious inqueries only, please.  please forward resumes to nicolemaddox@novorecruiting.com for immediate consideration.  

Background
Our client was founded in Denver, Colorado in 1981 with the goal of creating software that would be the platform for publishing.  Today, it maintains industry leadership with a product line that ties together traditional print publishing with enterprise content management, personalization, and tools for creating collaborative, cross-media workflows.  The company�s industry-leading design, publishing, personalization, and content management software allows publishers to efficiently create content once and deliver it anywhere, now.  

Job Description
Software Engineer will help develop exciting new products and technologies to serve all customers.  This candidate will be responsible for projects ranging from enterprise level web applications, to components within existing desktop applications, and all points in-between.  Project life cycles will vary from a couple of weeks to several months, and range in completion from prototypes to fully released products.  

The best candidate for the position is one that works well in an ever-changing, high energy environment.  One of the benefits of being in this position is an opportunity to work for the leader in desktop publishing that encourages employees to use their skills, with the freedom to be creative.  Another benefit is that employees have variety in technologies and would not be stuck in one technology.  

Duties and Responsibilities
� Communicate clearly with both internal & external team members at varying degree of technical capabilities to ensure a useful and quality software.
� Provide time estimates and schedules of projects 
� Be responsible for new research into areas of development with potential for use with the Quark product line.
� Demonstrate and instruct external development teams in the use of new technologies.

Qualifications
� 2 + years development experience in the following development areas: C/C++, Objective-C/Cocoa
� Experience in developing custom controls drawn using Quartz drawing engine
� Excellent object-oriented design skills
� Demonstrated written and oral communication skills
� Excellent interpersonal skills
� Ability to work effectively in an international team
� Knowledge of the publishing, multimedia, and/or graphics design industries a plus

Quark is hiring!!! I supposed it would be a challenging (very challenging) job. 

Since Tim Gill left they have really gone downhill. I interviewed with them once back in the '90s for a Mac programming job and they were only interested in Windows development - not the job I wanted. 

Still, I would recommend it. It is a nice, downtown Denver location and a Mac job to boot. There are very few of those in Denver. It looks like you'll get some good travel time to India as well (after [[XPress]] for Windows flopped they fired all the US developers and offshored everything). Even if they go belly up it will have been fun while it lasted. 

Go forth and save Quark. Defeat the evil [[InDesign]]!

----
''I really don't think it's appropriate to editorialize about someone else's job posting. We should be encouraging the posting of offers here, and making negative comments about individual offers does not further that goal. -CS''
----

----
Negative comments? "I would recommend it", "It is a nice, downtown Denver location", "a Mac job...There are very few of those in Denver". Did I editorialize? Guilty as charged. I would love to see Quark return to what they used to be. Quark has a horrible reputation in the Mac community and among anyone from Denver who wanted (or did) work there. Preliminary indications are that they have seen the error of their ways and are trying to hire local Mac programmers to try to recover the market share they have lost to Adobe.

It would be a very tough, but fun job to do. Downtown Denver is a great place to work. Quark would look great on a resume. It would be very good experience. I would classify this as positive editorializing.

'''However''', you bring up an excellent point. Should there be editorializing in the [[JobOffer]] page? Should this page be locked down to protect job postings or should we continue with the typical [[CocoaDev]] "community smackdown" above. Should there (is there?) another page where people can provide editorializing, advice, and hiring rumors specific to local areas? I supposed I could create such a page on [[CocoaDev]]. Is there a website dedicated to such feedback from the job seeker's perspective? The closest thing I know of is Craigslist. I see no reason why people have to wait patiently for job offers to come along instead of comparing notes and taking the initiative to find something.
----

----
Another poster here - I think "CS" is having a bad day today. Editorializing on pretty much anything is the "wiki" way. I challenge "CS" to prove otherwise. I saw nothing wrong with the comments above and even made some of my own in the posting below. There's nothing wrong with that; let's not be wiki nazis.

''' Bad-Ass Cocoa Programmer Needed!! ''' 

Enemy Tree, LLC is a new company that is dedicated to creating super fun and useful consumer applications specifically for the Mac. To make this happen I need an awesome, dedicated, passionate programmer to work with. Here is the low-down on what I am looking for:


''' Job Title: ''' 		 *Bad-Ass Cocoa Programmer and eventually Company Co-Owner

''' Job Description: ''' 	
 *You will be part of a two-person team. We will be developing one and only one product from now until its release. You will be the sole Cocoa programmer on the project. We will work together to create a team of people who will help with the project but it will strictly be on a volunteer basis. You will be responsible for coding the application, finding solutions to the numerous challenges that will definitely crop up on such a progressive application, and will be responsible for educating yourself in entirely new areas, as necessary, to fill gaps in knowledge to make the application work. This project will probably take as much time to code as it will to learn what is needed to make it work. Your ability to code as well as your ability and determination to learn are key to this projects success. You will also be helping with the programs design, interface, and usability as well as be needed to help with the website on occasion. 

''' Job Responsibilities: '''  You would be the sole programmer on this project and will be responsible for:

*Coding the application,
*Bug fixes,
*Sticking to the schedule, deadlines, & milestones,
*Some web stuff (but limited),
*Some design (but limited),
*Solving problems and finding solutions to challenges,
*Learning about the area that the application is targeted to,
*Development of future releases�   (There is more but this is a good start)


''' Job Qualifications: ''' 	This is a brief list of what I think it would take for you to be successful in this position:

*3-5 years of Cocoa programming experience (less experience OK commensurate with proof of skills),
*Up-to-date knowledge of Cocoa and Mac programming advancements.  This is a position that will leverage very modern Cocoa skills as well as provide a potential to advance Mac programming itself,
*Objective-C proficiency,
*[[XCode]] and Mac IDE�s experties,
*Intimate knowledge of OS X,
*Passionate about the Mac,
*Cooperative and collaborative personality. Open, honest, and constant communication is vital for this position,
*Strong communicator and proactive person,
*Must be detail-oriented,
*Strong analytical and problem-solving ability,
*Proof of skills will be required (a portfolio of work, a completed application�)


''' Additional Qualifications (but NOT required): ''' 

*College graduate (Master's Degree even better)
*Java programming skills


''' Project Description: '''  
 *Unfortunately, I can�t give away much of a description here, but what I can say is that the application is a consumer program that is meant to be fun, functional, & gorgeous. Think Delicious Library, iSale, Growl, Transmit, [[MemoryMiner]], & [[AppZapper]] in terms of super-cool consumer programs that are beautiful, well-designed, fun to use, and solidly programmed to get an idea of what I am looking to create. Sorry, but that is as close to an explanation of what the application is as I am willing to give out right now. Also, there is a very solid timeline for this project (8 months for development, ship in less than one year). For now, this application is meant for online, direct download, distribution.

''' Location: ''' 		
 *Wherever you are! Although it would be really nice to work with someone in person I would rather find an awesome person with incredible skills than someone who is just close to where I am. Definitely plan on meeting up a few times over the year, and talking just about every day. Meeting in person is very important.

''' Contact: ''' 	
 *If this sounds like something you are interested in and if you feel you are truly up to the challenge then please send a resume and a cover-letter to rokosj+cocoa[at]gmail.com. Only serious inquires will be responded to. A Design Document for the application (only partially completed) will be available to the final candidates so you can decide if this is really a project you are interested in.

----
Where are you located? What salary/benefits do you expect to be able to pay? How long can you sustain paying me until the product is revenue generating?
----


----
A recommendation, if I may? If you're expecting a Cocoa developer to be the 'sole' programmer, doing all the hard work of developing an app, perhaps that developer should be offered co-ownership immediately, not "eventually". You won't find many "bad-ass" programmers of ''any'' language willing to do all the hard work of the app for another person without co-ownership. Your offer quite simply is unappealing to anyone worth working with because of those terms alone.
----


----
I posted this job so let me reply to these 2 comments. First, I am now located in CT but this was not the case when this was posted. The job can be done from anywhere, as it states in the post. I left pay somewhat vague on purpose. I actually was looking forward to talking with people about this and not broadcasting it and only receiving mail from people more interested in the money than actually contributing to the Mac community. More on money when I reply to the second comment. Benefits: you would be on your own, like I am. I have never heard of a start up that could provide that. Now, for the second reply. As it pertains to "co-ownership" & what "eventually means." Again, this was left purposely vague in an effort to actually have a conversation with someone. Since I am close to deciding on a programmer I will expand for everyone�s edification. "co-ownership" meant 49% ownership in the company and an even split of 50/50 of profits. "eventual" meant that the day before the official release the partnership is made official (legally- no screwing around here). This is to ensure a completed product and no lose of control in case of making a poor hiring decision. As for pay in general, neither person gets paid until the product makes money. As a small start up this is the reality of the situation. In general, I know a lot of smaller companies probably start up when 2 friends decide to do something and that is how this started. As things moved on other pressures in my friends life forced him to step away from the project and knowing know one else who is a developer I turned to one of the best sources I could find (this community). When you really believe in an idea you have to push on in the face of adversity, and I definitely believe in this idea. 

Anyway, my advice for anyone into the future who comes across a posting like this, is to actually email the person and ask questions. The point of the post it to give a good amount of info, but to also not give to much away. If you are really interested, ask, and don't leave negative, know-it-all comments as a reply. I know I was, and am, always interested in talking to people who are passionate about contributing to the Mac community.
----


----
"Neither person gets paid until the product makes money." "No benefits." You can call that a job offer if you'd like. But it isn't a job - it is a gamble, charity or volunteer work with a possible payout at the end.

'''Instructions for employers posting offers here:'''

It would help if you place date information on your [[JobOffer]] so that users can determine how timely it is.

Provide as much information as you can, so that users can see what kind of expertise is desired. If you later want to withdraw the offer, you can always edit your offer, or add that you want no further contacts, but leave the job description so that others can see what kind of expertise has been sought. Other resources for the job search could be posted here as well (ideas are not as welcome as offers, but are still welcome!) This page is linked from the [[CocoaDev]] start page.

'''The posting just below is an example of how you might word your offer:'''

[[BestEye]], LLC. is looking for experienced Objective-C programmers interested in developing the next generation of image-editing and retouching applications for Mac OS X. Interested parties should be intimately familiar with Xcode and the Cocoa frameworks. Experience with [[CoreImage]], [[QuickTime]], and/or 2D graphics programming in general would be favorable.

There are currently [2005-08-03] two positions available. One for contract-based work, and a second for an in-house developer. Rates and hours are negotiable. For more information please contact David Will. <david at besteye dot com>

----

'''Can we PLEASE not have a 'hub page' for job offers, encouraging people to create new pages for each offer? Why can't we just put all job offers''' ''here'' '''rather than creating a whole bunch of pointless, time-sensitive pages?'''

----

I'm the one who wants to try this idea out. I guess I agree with you as to putting everything here. Then this page will be like an extension of [[CocoaDevBulletinBoard]]. If this is the only page of job offers on the site, it will still have information useful to job seekers. I guess what is most important is to direct those who actually have job offers to use this page, should they post an eventually "pointless, time-sensitive" page elsewhere. Originally, this page had become that sort of fossil... retaining utility only as an insight into what one employer wanted at one time. If you find my reply and reorganization acceptable, feel free to delete this exchange.
