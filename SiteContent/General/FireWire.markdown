High-speed serial connectivity standard developed by Apple. Also known as IEEE-1394 or iLink. (Sony started calling it iLink while Apple was deciding whether or not to make the name "General/FireWire" public. Of course, calling it iLink in general would have an even worse effect for Apple, so General/FireWire is now a public name for IEEE-1394. Of course, it's too late now; many PC peripherals call it iLink/IEEE-1394, with no mention of General/FireWire)
