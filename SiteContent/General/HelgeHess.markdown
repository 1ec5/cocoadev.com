Well, seems like I'm the project lead of General/OpenGroupware.org until I can pass over the job to someone more qualified and concentrate on development tasks ;-)

Besides that, I'm also the CEO (hear, hear) of General/ZideOne, a company which develops a General/WebDAV store for Outlook.

Please send me mail at mailto:me@helgehess.eu.
