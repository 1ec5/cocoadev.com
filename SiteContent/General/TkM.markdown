Hi!  Since you are viewing this page, I'll assume that you want to know something about me (unless you want to post a flame).  I'm just another Cocoa hobbyist who wishes that he was doing this stuff for a living (I'm currently stuck using C, writing firmware for [[PowerPC]] 603/750/74xx-based embedded systems).  I'm by no means an expert, though I've been writing various Cocoa programs ("Note: writing != completing") in my free time since 1998, when I bought my first [[NeXTstation]].  I'm a fan of this site, and I'll try to contribute when I can.

The only Cocoa program I've written that is semi-complete at this time is [[UserManager]]: http://www.avalon.net/~tmcintos/software/[[UserManager]]/index.html, which was supposed to be a replacement for the old NEXTSTEP/OPENSTEP tool of the same name.  It has been made rather redundant by the free availability of the [[MacOSXServer]] [[AdminTools]]: http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/apple/serveradmintools104.html, so it currently serves mainly as a test bed for trying out new Cocoa features that I want to familiarize myself with.  One thing it contains that may be useful in other contexts is my [[ObjectiveC]] translation/extension of Apple's [[DSWrappers]] C++ framework.  This is available via [[SubVersion]] at http://hoth.radiofreeomaha.net:3000/repos/[[UserManager]]/trunk/Source/[[DSWrappers]]/.  Apple's C++ version is available in the [[OpenDirectory]] SDK, available from http://developer.apple.com/darwin/projects/opendirectory/.  Update:  Apple has a similar framework here http://www.opensource.apple.com/darwinsource/10.5.6/[[DSTools]]-112/[[DSObjCWrappers]]/

You can post flames below, though I'm hoping you don't.  ;)
