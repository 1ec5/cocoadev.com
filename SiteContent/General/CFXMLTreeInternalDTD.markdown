Is it possible that the Core Foundation XML Parser, namely General/CFXMLTree, chokes on internal General/DTDs?

I had my XML validated with General/XMLLint, and Safari displays it as good as it can. Any ideas?

Thanks,

Alex

It's possible - it should just be skipping it. Can you point to a specific XML file it does this with or is it anythign with an internal DTD?
