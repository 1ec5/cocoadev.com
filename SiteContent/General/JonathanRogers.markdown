My name is Jonathan Rogers. I am 26 years old.

My best friend is [[RobRix]], who brought me to the mac, and to Cocoa. He is presently helping me to learn Cocoa programming and Objective-C, with the eventual goal of collaborating together on various game projects and other apps. We also have the goal of working together on development for the iPhone/iPod Touch platform.

I live in Atlanta, Georgia, and can be reached at quantumfoam at gmail dot com. 

My primary machine is a Macbook Pro 17-inch 2.16Ghz Core Duo with 1GB of memory. It suits me well for now, but I am saving for the newest model.

In my spare time, I enjoy reading, writing, hiking, photography, and modelmaking in various scales. As Rob can attest to, I also enjoy camping, especially in Canada!
