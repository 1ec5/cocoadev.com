General/NSObject is also the name of a protocol that the real General/NSObject implements, and thus all classes that inherit from General/NSObject do. Its most important functions is providing the General/MemoryManagement messages     release,     retain, and     retainCount, as well as the     self constant and the message     isProxy that returns TRUE if the class is a root class (i.e. it does not inherit from General/NSObject). - General/PietroGagliardi

Some classes which do not inherit from General/NSObject, e.g. General/NSProxy, also implement the General/NSObject protocol, so they support all of the essential features of General/NSObject.
