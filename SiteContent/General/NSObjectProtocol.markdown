[[NSObject]] is also the name of a protocol that the real [[NSObject]] implements, and thus all classes that inherit from [[NSObject]] do. Its most important functions is providing the [[MemoryManagement]] messages <code>release</code>, <code>retain</code>, and <code>retainCount</code>, as well as the <code>self</code> constant and the message <code>isProxy</code> that returns TRUE if the class is a root class (i.e. it does not inherit from [[NSObject]]). - [[PietroGagliardi]]

Some classes which do not inherit from [[NSObject]], e.g. [[NSProxy]], also implement the [[NSObject]] protocol, so they support all of the essential features of [[NSObject]].
