How do I load an Image into an General/NSImageCell.?
I want to add an General/NSImage I open previously to a Table using an General/NSTableController.

I want to build an application just like the binding example on
http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/General/CocoaBindings/Tasks/images.html 

Thanx Alex
