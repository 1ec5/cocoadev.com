Can selecting a value in an General/NSPopupButton who's contentValues are bound to an General/NSArrayController's arrangedObjects change which object in the General/NSArrayController's contentArray is being selected?

How can I do this?

Got it!  I forgot to bind the selectedIndex of the General/NSPopupButton to the selectionIndex of the General/NSArrayController.
