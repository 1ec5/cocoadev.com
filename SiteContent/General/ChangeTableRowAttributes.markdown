I have an General/NSTableView connected with Bindings to a General/CoreData store. I want to be able to change the color of a row's text when a certain column contains a certain value. I want the text of the entire row to be a different color, not just that cell. I know I need to subclass something, but I'm not sure what. Should I subclass General/NSCell for each column, or something else? Any help is much appreciated. Thanks. --General/LoganCollins
