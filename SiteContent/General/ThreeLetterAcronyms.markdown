TLA is a TLA for this topic.

[Topic]

The most important one!!

RTM:  Read The Manual! (I've only ever heard RTFM... maybe it's the crowd I hang around with... -- General/AndrewMiner)

CNET has a number of acronyms on:  http://www.cnet.com/Resources/Info/Glossary/

----

There are a lot more General/TLAs, General/MFLAs, General/UCFLAs and General/SLATNUs at http://acronymfinder.com

What are the above acronyms supposed to be short for? Normally we have TLA and ETLA for "Extended Three Letter Acronym", it's a joke, not a system! :-)

Yes, I find it funny that none of the above (MFLA, UCFLA, and SLATNU) are listed at http://acronymfinder.com...

**Meaningless Four-Letter Acronyms, Utterly Confusing Five-Letter Acronyms, and Six-Letter Acronyms That Nobody Understands, of course!**

General/OneLetterAcronyms

C - cookie :-)

*Stop it! this is really not funny... OLA is not itself a one letter acronym...*

**How about O for One letter acronym, and 2LA for 2 Letter Acronym? :-)**

And the idea about collecting a lot of acronyms in this Wiki is pretty stupid, since there already is a search engine for this. We should only collect on acronyms which are special for this site or General/ObjectiveC.

Not really.  This may make life a bit easier for people new to the computer industry.  The other day I was looking at some .NET stuff and it had too many
undefined acronyms and I thought these guys could take a letter from General/CocoaDev....

Yes -- people new to the computer industry will certainly search General/CocoaDev for the acronyms they do not know. Especially because it's so darn easy finding the acronym here on General/CocoaDev!

I agree that this is a useful idea because most of the collection here is related to Cocoa, but I do find it humorous that what was once a silly post has now turned into something useful. 


*Why do we have a profusion of alphabetized pages on this?  It seems like a misdirection of effort to factor a list of acronyms into alphabetical order, chunked as such... why not just clump them onto this page?  ... or maybe this is just the way that my now-defeated General/FearOfAddingClasses has decided to manifest itself.  General/FearOfAddingPages?(General/PromptingQuestion pattern) *

**I am finding myself in agreement. Alphabetization seems only to slow me down. I can't be bothered to look at any of the actual acronyms now because they're on other pages (;**

Yeah.  Why are these even here, again?  If they are going to be here, they should all be on one page.
