I'm currently a student at New York University studying Computer Science. I've done a fair bit of Java programming. I only wish Apple would bring back support for the General/JavaBridge so I could use it for my Cocoa work as well.

I've released some open source code based on General/MattGemmell's original code. I haven't set up a website yet so it's currently hosted on his page: http://iratescotsman.com/products/source/. Look for the General/ImagePopUpButton example.
