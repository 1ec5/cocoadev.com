What's new at [[CocoaDev]]?

'''May 6, 2008''' - Please read this possible plan for [[CocoaDev]] and send feedback if you like: http://stevenf.com/archive/cocoadev-refresh.php (Sorry, I haven't had much time to work on the site refresh.  I haven't forgotten about it.  It's still on my to-do list.)

'''January 9, 2008''' - Added a new Forums link that is a better option for free-form discussion threads and Q&A.  Please begin to migrate active discussions to the forums, and reserve the wiki for "encyclopedic" content.  The "Search [[CocoaDev]] with Google" form on the home page should cover BOTH the wiki and the forums, once Google notices the new section.  Also, did another round of slight cosmetic changes. -- [[StevenFrank]]

'''January 7, 2008''' - It looks better in Helvetica.  Trust me!  -- [[StevenFrank]] ([[StevenFrank]], you also didn't list the fact that viewport settings were also added for the iPhone -- didn't like being the "bad" example in Apple's videos, huh? ;D -- [[EmanueleVulcano]])

'''May 29, 2007''' - [[CocoaDev]] has been moved to a new Xserve to help improve performance. -- [[StevenFrank]]

''' May 20, 2007''' - The [[CocoaLocalizers]] page has been added as a community resource for volunteer localizers. -- [[JoelLevin]]

'''January 6, 2007''' - The [[ObjectLibrary]] was too big to be edited, so Iï¿½ve started splitting it into categories. See [[ObjectLibraryRefactoring]]. -- [[JensAyton]]

'''November 21, 2006''' - I've added another new anti-spam measure.  Please let me know if you have any trouble saving legitimate pages as a result.  -- [[StevenFrank]]

'''November 8, 2006''' - I've replaced the somewhat out-of-control [[JobOffer]] page with a real honest-to-goodness job board.  There's also a link to it in the navigation bar.  I think this will be beneficial both to recruiters and prospective candidates alike.  Don't forget to subscribe to the RSS feed, if you're looking for a job!  To hopefully get things rolling, for the first two weeks, employers can post a listing for only $50 using the coupon code GRANDOPENING  -- [[StevenFrank]]  (please email me if you have any comments or concerns about this)

'''October 24, 2006''' - There's a new, improved Google search box on the [[FindPage]] that searches other Cocoa development sites in addition to [[CocoaDev]]. -- [[StevenFrank]]

'''May 22, 2006''' - Cosmetic changes to the <code>\\%\\%REPLY\\%\\%</code> tag are now live. -- [[KritTer]]
