Does it rock? Or does it suck? (You know it rocks!)  -- General/MikeTrent 

General/PowerPC is a 32- and 64-bit RISC *microprocessor architecture* originally developed by the AIM alliance (a partnership between **A**pple, **I**BM, and **M**otorola) in 1991.

The first General/PowerPC implementation was the 32-bit 601, released in 1992.  The 601 was a transitional design, based on IBM's existing work on a single-chip POWER processor and Motorola's m88k bus architecture, and as such, it deviated slightly from the General/PowerPC architecture (for example, it had no Time Base or DBAT registers).

The first processors to fully implement the 32-bit subset of the General/PowerPC architecture were the 603 (Motorola) and 604 (IBM) series.  Next came the 750 series (74x,75x - known in Apple parlance as the General/GeeThree).  Motorola improved the 750 design, adding the General/AltiVec unit, to produce the 74xx or General/GeeFour series (7400/7410/744x/745x).

The first implementation of the original 64-bit architecture was the 620, which was essentially a 64-bit 604. It was produced, but only after so many delays that it was superceeded by the next generation of General/PowerPC chips soon after its release.  IBM may have used it in some of its servers.

Another interesting General/PowerPC processor is the 64-bit 970, produced by IBM, which is a redesigned single-core POWER4 with an General/AltiVec unit attached.  This chip is used in Apple's General/PowerMac General/GeeFive.  The 970FX is a faster, lower power version of the 970.  The 970MP is a dual-core version of the 970.

There are, of course, many other General/PowerPCs than the ones used in Macs.  The Xbox360 will use a custom General/PowerPC processor.  The PlayStation3 will use the POWER3-derived Cell processor.  Motorola (now General/FreeScale) has a wide array of processors targeted at the embedded systems market.  IBM produces processors for the embedded systems and server markets (the POWER4, for instance, jumps immediately to mind).  These other processors are compatible with the original General/PowerPC architecture to varying degrees:  many of the embedded processors implement the *General/BookE* architecture, and many of IBM's processors implement the POWER3/4/5 architectures.
