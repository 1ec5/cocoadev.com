Foundation's General/NSPoint structure, defined in General/NSGeometry.h

    typedef struct {
    General/CGFloat x;
    General/CGFloat y;
} General/NSPoint;

See General/NSPointFunctions for useful General/NSPoint stuff.

There is a pre-defined constant, General/NSZeroPoint, which is what you'd expect it to be.
