Hi, I am an eccentric Cocoa/[[CoreAudio]]/C++ developer, with some soft realtime programming experience. Sometimes I like to troll around here and make a fool of myself, othertimes I actually write software. I lived in Toronto, Canada (a great place when it's not winter) and can be reached at (((jurksztowicz _AT_ gmail _D0T_ com))). Holy crap, I live in China, how did that happen?

''Hey there! Not sure I approve of trolling, but always good to get more Cocoa programmers :)''

Oh yeah, I just released the (woefully incomplete) source code to an audio engine called [[ArkonnektSound]]. There are plenty of cool cocoa (and C++) classes for audio apps, including a cocoa wrapper for [[AudioUnits]] which provides [[NSCoding]] compliance, preset loading/saving, Cocoa/Carbon editor window display; And a wave view class which displays a digital sequence as a waveform, in a zoomable view with an overview.

I don't develop [[ArkonnektSound]] anymore, I ended up refactoring most of the code into their own little packages. A few packages should be ready in a short while. The [[ArkSoundKit]] [[AudioUnit]] Cocoa wrappers are ready now, but everything else will have to wait until I can eke out a few minutes of time.
