Aaron Sittig is, by day, a mac dev for Napster, by night, a hacker for [[BlackholeMedia]]. Aaron has been developing Mac software since 1998. He is in the midst of internal turmoil, trying to decide if he should commit to Cocoa or [[CarbonEvents]] (Update: He takes the road less traveled and settles for polygamy)

(Update: He sleeps instead of working for Napster now.  The rest remains true.  Especially the eternal internal turmoil. !!  And the bald head.)
