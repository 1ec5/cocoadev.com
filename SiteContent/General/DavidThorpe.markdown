Hello! I have only seven things to show you:

http://mutablelogic.com/cocoa/[[WebServerFramework]].zip - an embeddable framework which handles HTTP requests. Currently limited to GET, HEAD, PUT and DELETE (see [[WebServerFramework]])

http://mutablelogic.com/cocoa/[[ExpressionEvaluator]].zip - example of how to use Lex and Yacc with Objective-C (see [[UsingLexAndYaccWithObjectiveC]])

http://mutablelogic.com/cocoa/[[NSFileManager]]-Utils.zip - various file manager additions, one of which is used by my web server framework.

http://mutablelogic.com/cocoa/[[NSString]]-[[CSVUtils]].zip - an [[NSString]] extension to import Comma-separated values into arrays (see [[ReadWriteCSVAndTSV]])

http://mutablelogic.com/cocoa/[[NSData]]-Utils.zip - [[NSData]] additions for hashing (SHA1 and MD5). A somewhat derivative work I think.

http://code.google.com/p/gd-kit/ - Use the GD graphics library in Objective C, when you can't use [[NSImage]] to do your dirty work (see [[GDFramework]]).

http://code.google.com/p/postgres-kit/ - Embed a [[PostgreSQL]] server in your Cocoa application, also includes a client framework and server control preference pane.


My email address is "djt" at the server you download the above files from. I live in London, United Kingdom. I work for Google and [[YouTube]].

For Line [[NSArray]]'' theFields = [theLine componentsSeparatedByString:@","];   in [[NSString]] extension to import CSV example to read [[NSArray]]'' theFields = [theLine componentsSeparatedByString:@", "]; there needs to be a space after the coma , it worked great! Thanks
