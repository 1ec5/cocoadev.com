Hello! I have only seven things to show you:

http://mutablelogic.com/cocoa/General/WebServerFramework.zip - an embeddable framework which handles HTTP requests. Currently limited to GET, HEAD, PUT and DELETE (see General/WebServerFramework)

http://mutablelogic.com/cocoa/General/ExpressionEvaluator.zip - example of how to use Lex and Yacc with Objective-C (see General/UsingLexAndYaccWithObjectiveC)

http://mutablelogic.com/cocoa/General/NSFileManager-Utils.zip - various file manager additions, one of which is used by my web server framework.

http://mutablelogic.com/cocoa/General/NSString-General/CSVUtils.zip - an General/NSString extension to import Comma-separated values into arrays (see General/ReadWriteCSVAndTSV)

http://mutablelogic.com/cocoa/General/NSData-Utils.zip - General/NSData additions for hashing (SHA1 and MD5). A somewhat derivative work I think.

http://code.google.com/p/gd-kit/ - Use the GD graphics library in Objective C, when you can't use General/NSImage to do your dirty work (see General/GDFramework).

http://code.google.com/p/postgres-kit/ - Embed a General/PostgreSQL server in your Cocoa application, also includes a client framework and server control preference pane.


My email address is "djt" at the server you download the above files from. I live in London, United Kingdom. I work for Google and General/YouTube.
