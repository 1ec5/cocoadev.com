Working on ''[[AppleScriptabilty]]'' of my Colloquy and [[ChatCore]] project I was in dire need of a way to take an object specifier [[AEDesc]] and resolve it. [[AEResolve]] didn't help, as it only works with applications that have dozens of assessors installed, not based on key-value coding.

I needed a way to pass object specifiers to an [[AppleScript]] subroutine and get object specifiers from a script's result.

After hours of painful searches I found nothing helpful. Time for ''class-dump'' I said.

Doing a dump of the Foundation framework (''class-dump -s -C [[NSScriptObjectSpecifier]] /System/Library/Frameworks/Foundation.framework/Foundation''), I found my  answer!

<code>
@interface [[NSScriptObjectSpecifier]] ([[NSPrivate]])
+ (id) _objectSpecifierFromDescriptor:([[NSAppleEventDescriptor]] '') descriptor inCommandConstructionContext:(id) context;
- ([[NSAppleEventDescriptor]] '') _asDescriptor;
@end
</code>

A quick test on my script proved my joyous find. I don't know what ''inCommandConstructionContext'' is, and passing nil to it worked.

This really needs to be public, methinks. ï¿½[[TimothyHatcher]]

As of Leopard it is public: <code>+[[[NSScriptObjectSpecifier]] objectSpecifierWithDescriptor:]</code> and <code>-[[[NSScriptObjectSpecifier]] descriptor]</code>. Slowly, slowly, Apple exposes to us the [[APIs]] they know are needed to write working code... :) ---[[WimLewis]]
