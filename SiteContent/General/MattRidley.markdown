Matt Gemmell is a Scottish software engineer who's now writing about himself in the third person. After having worked for Adobe Systems for a few years as Product Manager for [[GoLive]] Extensibility, he's returning to university in October 2001 to get his Software Engineering degree.

Matt started programming in Sinclair Spectrum BASIC a long time ago, then moved on to [[TruBasic]], Pascal, C, C++ and Ada95. Over the last few years, he's mainly been writing code/scripts in [[REALbasic]], [[JavaScript]], Java and good old [[AppleScript]]. K&R remains his constant companion.

Matt discovered Cocoa and Objective-C in OS X DP4, but only really started seriously using [[ProjectBuilder]] etc after getting hold of OS X 10.0 (early in the morning on March 24th, of course).

As a final note, Matt is possibly the most obsessive Star Trek fan in existence. He tolerates current operating systems (even the beauty and elegance of OS X) on the assumption that one day we'll all be using LCARS. Such is his devotion to Star Trek that he puts up with the endless obligatory "Scotty" jokes people think he hasn't yet heard.
