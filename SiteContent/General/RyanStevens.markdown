Describing [[RyanStevens]] here...

I'm 25 and live in/near Oakland, Oregon on approx. 90 acres. Ryan is my middle name and it's only when I sign checks that I give a hint at my first, don't ask.

I've been doing OSX development (mostly for myself/fun) since getting the Public Beta a couple weeks after it came out. Before that I taught myself Java on OS9 (yes, that sucked). I've never really made any money at it ($50-ish, all on the same open-source app no less), but it's something to do.

I'm a single dad with a 5 year old son, James. He's turning 6 in March. He's a game-aholic so I bought Unity Indie for us to play with...very cool app. We may not make the next Doom3 or whatever but something more like [[MarbleBlast]] is definitely do-able.

I was bored and had an itch, check out my little Cocoa game...

It makes use of [[CCDColoredButtonCell]] and [[AMViewAnimation]].

If I can keep from playing with Unity for a bit I've got an update to this that adds window tinting ala [[NSWindowCategory]]. I want to get the gradient-tinting working properly first but..eventually. Maybe I'll just rewrite it (it is small afterall) and get the source up.

Oh, personal pages suck btw. ;-)
