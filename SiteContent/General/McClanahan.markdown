Describe [[McClanahan]] here.

\'mek-klan-a-han\  the last name of one Kelsey [[McClanahan]].  

There we go, now it has been described :)

Apparently, these web pages treat words with more than one UPPER case letter as a dictionary type entry.  Unfortunately for me my last name is properly spelled with two upper case letters.  Hence this definition to get rid of the quirky floating question mark appended to my name.
