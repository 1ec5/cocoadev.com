Some things I have made that you might get some use from:


*https://github.com/robrix/objectbinder  - an IB3 plugin to let you bind arbitrary properties of arbitrary objects to other objects in your nib. Sort of like General/NSObjectController turned inside out. Doesnâ€™t work as of Xcode 4, and there are probably better ways to accomplish this anyway.

*http://gist.github.com/162745 - General/NSManagedObject copying & deep copying methods which you can find on github

*http://github.com/robrix/RXConcreteProtocol - mixins for General/ObjC

*http://github.com/robrix/RXAssertions - simpler, more convenient assertions for General/OCUnit

*http://github.com/robrix/xcode-light - simpler integration between General/TextMate and Xcode than the default bundle

*http://github.com/robrix/hammer - a parser for context-free grammars based on [http://matt.might.net/articles/parsing-with-derivatives/ Brzozowski's derivative]
