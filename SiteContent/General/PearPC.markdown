Open-source General/PowerPC emulator for x86 computers (both Linux and Windows), and is capable of running the General/MacOS, but at its current state can only emulate a G3, lacking any General/AltiVec features of a G4 or G5. Runs extremely slow, due to the fact that it is merely emulating the processor, and isn't very well suited for any useful tasks.
