General/QTKit is  an Objective-C interface to General/QuickTime available on Tiger, and also available with QT7 on Panther. It supercedes the Cocoa classes General/NSMovieView and General/NSMovie with a larger set of classes which provide a comprehensive interface into General/QuickTime from Objective-C. In addition to basic playback and tweaking, General/QTKit allows full-blown editing and other such goodies.

General/QTKit is also the name of an open-source wrapper around General/QuickTime that was made outside of Apple. For information on that wrapper, see the General/QTKitOSS page.
