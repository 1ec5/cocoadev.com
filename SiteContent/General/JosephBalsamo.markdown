The carbon-based life-form known as Joseph Balsamo is one of the "old men" of the group, having started programming in 1974 on an old PDP-11, then buying a TRS-80 when it became available and an Apple ][ shortly after that in 1978.

He's been programming the Mac since 1984 and while he has, admittedly, done some work for the "Dark Side", he's now convinced that there's a Hailstorm soon to come upon the .NET and that it's time to Fight the Future with Cocoa.

Joe is experienced in C, C++, Java and even the evil C#, until he was enlightened by General/ObjectiveCee, which he is currently learning.
