It is almost impossible to imagine a Cocoa program that does not use C loops.  They are just too useful.  Here are the different kinds.  Wonder what each of them does?

----
The for loop
----
<code>
for (i = 0; i <= 10; i++)

{

}

</code>
----
The while loop
----
<code>
while (i<=10)

{

}
</code>
----
The do while loop
----
<code>
do

{

}

while ();
</code>
