Currently 18 years old, living in Vancouver, BC, Canada. I've been doing Obj-C/Cocoa programming for a while now (a few years), and I also enjoy web/CSS and graphic design in my spare time. I own a [[PowerBook]] G4, which is what I work with every waking second. ;) I'm also a massive rock/alternative music addict.

I manage what I consider a small shareware company, though it's been surprisingly successful.
