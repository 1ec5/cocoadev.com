A General/DataMember, also General/InstanceVariable or ivar, is a data variable which is a part of General/AnObject. 

It can be many things, from something as simple as an integer:

    
int oneDataMember;


Through more complex things like strings:

    
char* anotherDataMember;


Up to complex things like selectors:

    
SEL* aSelector;


And advanced things like objects:

    
id someObject;
General/NSString * stringObject;


A General/DataMember is sometimes also referred to as an General/InstanceVariable (or "ivar" for short) because it is a variable that only exists within an instance of a class.
