Wiki sites work because of collaboration. They work because of respect. They work because of people tidying things without drawing attention to themselves.

General/PageCops are those who, despite the fact that the system is resilient to almost any sort of attack, still take it upon themselves to loudly discourage General/PageCriminals.

Please, don't be either a General/PageCop or a General/PageCriminal. Just fix things and move on.

(Perhaps General/WikiCop/General/WikiCriminal would be better titling. Refactor as necessary.)
