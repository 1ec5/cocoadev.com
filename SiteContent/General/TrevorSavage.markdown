 Currently in the 9th grade, I had previously tried to program General/MacOS 8, but found it too complex. The one book that got me anywhere other than through C was Mac Programming for Dummies, but it didn't get me far enough to write much on my own. As soon as I heard about Cocoa I wanted General/MacOSX, eventually getting it for Christmas 2001, and working on my skills since.

 In the summer of 2002, the instructor of the computer camp I attended recommended General/PerlLang, and I've been programming it since. Considering going back to Cocoa with the knowledge I've picked up here. Got the original Learning Cocoa book a few months after General/MacOSX and planing on purchasing Cocoa Programming soon.


 I know a bit of C, HTML, Scheme, General/PerlLang, hardly any General/ObjC, and do a fair bit of web design on my dual 450Mhz General/GeeFour. Current Cocoa project is a simple RPG engine. Which was accidentally deleted.
