 Currently in the 9th grade, I had previously tried to program [[MacOS]] 8, but found it too complex. The one book that got me anywhere other than through C was Mac Programming for Dummies, but it didn't get me far enough to write much on my own. As soon as I heard about Cocoa I wanted [[MacOSX]], eventually getting it for Christmas 2001, and working on my skills since.

 In the summer of 2002, the instructor of the computer camp I attended recommended [[PerlLang]], and I've been programming it since. Considering going back to Cocoa with the knowledge I've picked up here. Got the original Learning Cocoa book a few months after [[MacOSX]] and planing on purchasing Cocoa Programming soon.


 I know a bit of C, HTML, Scheme, [[PerlLang]], hardly any [[ObjC]], and do a fair bit of web design on my dual 450Mhz [[GeeFour]]. Current Cocoa project is a simple RPG engine. Which was accidentally deleted.
