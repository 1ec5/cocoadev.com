I am an experienced Java developer primarily working in the life sciences.  Most of my work is server side database apps, though a number of Web apps, some PHP, a bit of Python, six hellish months of Perl, and a couple of nice GUI editors are also in my past.  I am currently working as one of the consultants for Alodar Systems <www.alodar.com>.

I did a fair amount of [[WebObjects]] in 2003, and used the WO-inspired toolkits Tapestry and Cayenne in 2004.

I first ran into Cocoa/[[AppKit]] back in 1990, when a professor at Berkeley let me play with his small farm of [[NeXT]] cubes.  I loved display [[PostScript]], but could never lay my hands on the shekels to buy one.

I did a fair amount of Mac development, including [[PowerPlant]] and hand done GNE code, when I worked for an econometric forecasting company in the mid nineties, though most of my time was spent on Windows.  The Mac was more fun to program, but I really considered myself a cross platform C++ type.

Apple buying [[NeXT]] was a great thing for me, as it meant that the coolness of Cocoa had come to a platform I could afford and like.  I have written a few small Cocoa programs, but really only consider it to have clicked in the last year or so.

I am now running the Orange County cocoa-heads chapter - drop me a line if you want to attend, or hit the main site at <http://www.cocoaheads.org/>
