My name is Matthew Hutton.

I am a second/third year mathematics student at Warwick University ( http://www.warwick.ac.uk ), I am also Eraserhead ( http://forums.macrumors.com/member.php?u=61325 ) on [[MacRumors]], and I am the creator of D&D Manager ( http://www.erasersoft.com/ ). Other than Cocoa I can also program in Java and a (very) little bit in C.
