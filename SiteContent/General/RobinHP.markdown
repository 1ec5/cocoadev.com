Figured I'd finally add a personal page for myself. I've been programming since about 1992, beginning with [[HyperTalk]] and moving through BASIC (on an old Apple ][e), [[AppleScript]], C, C++, PHP, and now Cocoa. I finally have released a piece of software! Who would've thought! It's called [[AcidSearch]], and it adds Search Channels to Safari (similar to iSeek). http://www.pozytron.com/acidsearch.

Peace.
