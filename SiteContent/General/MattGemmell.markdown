Matt Gemmell is a Scottish software engineer who's now writing about himself in the third person. After having worked for Adobe Systems for a few years as Product Manager for General/GoLive Extensibility, he started his own little software company: Instinctive Code, which you can find at http://instinctivecode.com/ . If you need a Mac OS X Cocoa or iPhone app, get in touch.

Matt started programming in Sinclair Spectrum BASIC a long time ago, then moved on to General/TruBasic, Pascal, C, C++ and Ada95. He has experience in several programming and scripting languages, including PHP, General/JavaScript, Java, Python and good old General/AppleScript. K&R remains his constant companion. The languages he currently uses most from day to day are Objective-C and PHP.

Matt discovered Cocoa and Objective-C in OS X DP4, but only really started seriously using General/ProjectBuilder etc after getting hold of OS X 10.0 (early in the morning on March 24th, of course). Since then, Matt has been a full-time Cocoa developer, and has contributed several apps (including the slightly famous iCal Birthday Shifter) and plenty of source-code to the Cocoa community. See his Cocoa Source Code page ( http://mattgemmell.com/source/ ) for all that stuff.
