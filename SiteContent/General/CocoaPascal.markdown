Recently I wanted to try out Pascal, so I downloaded General/FreePascal [http://www.freepascal.org/fpcmac.html].
Wonderful.
But one problem: I was hoping I could use some pascal in real development, IE Cocoa. The only packages for GUI available on the General/FreePascal site are for GTK. OK, so there is "Generalized Graphics Interface" but that is linux only.
Is there any project for a bridge to pascal or is one already in the works? So far I've only seen General/RubyCocoa, General/PerlBridge, General/JavaBridge, and Python-Cocoa (?).

People still use Pascal?

----

Yes. They do.

...

People also still use C++  too. and Visual Basic, right? Pascal isn't really that bad. 

Yes, it is. I doubt you'll see a Pascal "bridge" because firstly it doesn't have objects and secondly it's an EXTREMELY statically-typed language. Just use Objective-C.

Umm, what are you talking about? It's HARD to find Pascal without objects. General/FreePascal for General/MacOSX has objects. I think General/GNUPascal does. 
And yes, it is statically typed for the most part. Java isn't exactly dynamic.
