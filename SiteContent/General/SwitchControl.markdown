[[SwitchControl]] is an open-source control based on the [[TimeMachine]].prefPane 'big button' hosted at http://code.google.com/p/switchcontrol. It's also resolution independent as all the drawing is done at runtime.

The control only exposes a single binding; [[NSValueBinding]] expecting an [[NSNumber]] wrapping a BOOL.

[[SwitchControl]] is dependent on another one of my projects Amber.framework which is available at http://code.google.com/p/amber-framework.
