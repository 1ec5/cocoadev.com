Well I probably do not have enough Cocoa expertise to warrant my very own page, but I am making one anyway because it gives me the jollies.

I am a Cocoa newbie to novice as of July 2007.

I am in Tucson, AZ and would love to hear from any Cocoa developers [especially] in Tucson / southern Arizona.  

I am a stay at home Dad too, and currently only developing apps for my own use.  My main project is something to manage my eBay sales.

This project will hopefully increase my selling efficiency and profitability so much that I will become rich rich rich.

Ultimately I will use my Cocoa programs to help me take over the world.  Or a world.  Somewhere.
