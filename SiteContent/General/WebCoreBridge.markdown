Defined in [[WebCore]], available as part of Darwin.

From the header file:

[[WebCoreBridge]] objects are used by [[WebCore]] to abstract away operations that need
to be implemented by library clients, for example [[WebKit]]. The objects are also
used in the opposite direction, for simple access to [[WebCore]] functions without dealing
directly with the KHTML C++ classes.
