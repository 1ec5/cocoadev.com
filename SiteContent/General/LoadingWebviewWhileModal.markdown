I noticed that loading in a General/WebView does not work when the application is running a modal, is this a bug or is it supposed to be that way? And is there a way to force the General/WebView to load even while the application is running a modal? Thanks in advance, General/PabloGomez

I just found the answer to my question. Apparently General/NSURLConnection does not work while not in the main run loop. It seems to be a known issue, but if anyone has any workarounds please let me know. General/PabloGomez

Just found a discussion about this at http://lists.apple.com/archives/Webkitsdk-dev/2004/Jun/threads.html#00034 there's a hack there if anyone's interested.

I've just implemented a workaround (a bit of a hack and a bit complicated but it works). Here's what I did: create a sub class of General/NSURLConnection, use poseAsClass:, catch initWithRequest:delegate: and run it in a worker thread. Catch all subsequent method calls to General/NSURLConnection by using a proxy and catch all delegate callbacks and forward them back to the main thread when they occur. Note that some of the General/NSURLConnection delegate callbacks aren't run on the main thread (such as connection:willCacheResponse:). I paused the main thread whenever the run loop in the worker thread was about to wake (using a General/CFRunLoopObserver) to ensure that General/URLConnection ran synchronously with the main thread.
