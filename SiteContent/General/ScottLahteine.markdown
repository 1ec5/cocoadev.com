I'm a writer / computer programmer / musician living in Portland, Oregon, USA. I wrote some ancient software like the Amiga version of "Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure" and "[[DinoWars]]." More recently I wrote [[FretPet]] for Mac OS 7/8/9. Lately I've been programming Mac OS X and making software like these titles:


*[[TabletMagic]] - An open source driver for obsolete Wacom tablets.
*[[MacFrotz]] - A shell for playing Infocom and other text adventure games.
*[[FretPet]] X - The next generation of this guitar-based music sequencer.
*DSR - A 2D action/adventure game in deep space.
*FAZ - A soon-to-be-released arcade game involving birds and lances.
