I am a graduate of the Electrical Engineering Program (class of 1993) from the University of Texas at Austin.  I worked for the University of Texas at Applied Research Labs as both a coop student and a full time employee.  While there I designed analog and digital circuit for active SONAR.  I left ARL in 1998 to work at a small start up company (e-Net, which later became zeroPlus.com) designing hardware for voice over IP (General/VoIP) applications.

e-Net laid me off in the 1999 and went out of business about 6 months later.  I found an embedded programming position at Texas Instruments in the Battery Management group and have been there since 1999.

I am married with two kids (2 and 4) and live in Austin, Texas
