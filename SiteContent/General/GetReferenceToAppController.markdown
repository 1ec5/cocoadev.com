I'm extending Apple's Quartz Composer Player example, and I'm trying to neaten things up so I won't get overwhelmed as I expand.  I have an General/AppController class to handle the usual UI and logic concerns.  I've also subclassed General/NSApplication to capture key presses while the full screen opengl context is being displayed.  My General/NSApp subclass just overrides sendEvent: and wants to send a message to the appController when certain interesting events occur.  I can't figure out how to get a reference to the General/AppController instance that I've instantiated in IB.  Am I going about this the right way?  I can't seem to find any information on the topic.

Never mind.. I just used [self delegate] and made General/AppController the delegate of my General/NSApp subclass.
