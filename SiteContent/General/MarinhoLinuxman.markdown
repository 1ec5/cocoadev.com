Hello, I'm a Linux user since 1997, program since 94 and now I work in [[PacaBrasil]] Producoes Digitais (http://www.pacabrasil.com/) 

I program in Delphi, PHP, Pascal, Kylix, and others languages, but now I'm trying learn more and more about Objective C and Cocoa.

I'm a braZilian guy, and my website/weblog URL is http://www.pacabrasil.com/marinho/ or http://www.cocoa.com.br

Contact me to marinhobrandao@bol.com.br or ICQ 39085669.
