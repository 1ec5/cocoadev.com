I work on large system performance simulation and modeling at Oracle.
I intend to hack on my long list of half-started Cocoa projects someday, but who knows when that'll be.

**General/WebLog**: http://michael-mccracken.net/

**Active Cocoa Projects That I'm Not Involved in Anymore**

General/BibDesk, a bibTeX bibliography manager. http://bibdesk.sourceforge.net/

Skim, a PDF reader that improves on Preview: http://skim-app.sourceforge.net/
(I helped a bit with design but only contribute occasionally)

**Dead Projects:**

Blapp, a blosxom weblog authoring tool. http://blapp.sourceforge.net/
It's still available from sourceforge, but hasn't been updated in years. I now use General/MarsEdit to post to my new wordpress blog.

General/CodeSearch, which was at http://disco.ucsd.edu/General/CodeSearch/ , is now temporarily off-line. Anyone who's interested in reviving the idea is welcome to contact me.

It was a web site that allows you to search through the source code of several open source projects.
