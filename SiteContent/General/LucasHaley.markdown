Heya! I'm Lucas Haley, a hobbyist Cocoa programmer in Portland, Oregon.

I'm currently developing a DM toolkit for 3rd Edition Dungeons and Dragons. Please get in touch if you're wanting more info! Also -- I would love some guidance... if you are in Portland, and would be willing to look over my ideas for a meal or two, please let me know.
