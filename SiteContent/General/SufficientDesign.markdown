A [[SufficientDesign]] satisfies the current requirements. This is the most important point and should be the primary goal for any design.

'''Taking It Too Far''' (also known as [[OverDesign]])

A design can be overly sufficient - meaning it satisfies more then the current requirements. This is usually caused in an attempt to make a [[FlexibleDesign]] and results in adding unnecessary complications to the design. To avoid this, start with a [[SimpleDesign]] then apply [[ReFactoring]] to add needed flexibility.
