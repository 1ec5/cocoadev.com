Kritter (Chris Purcell, England)


I'm doing a General/CompSci General/PhD at Cambridge Uni (England). I have two publications now - sweet! See http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1011767.1011829 and http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/General/TechReports/UCAM-CL-TR-639.html

Some things I have been responsible for: 
*General/FoundationCollectionsPalette, General/DesignMatrix, General/KTLLMutableArray, General/DesignCollection
* Code changes to this site's engine to make it do its job better - page history and topics are my legacy.
* Garnering a reputation for being unwholesomely interested in atomic operations. [**not unwholesomely interested in so much as unwholesomely *good at*, I think**] Stuff like General/ProducersAndConsumerModel may have caused that.


Current obsessions:

* Low-level design of lock-free concurrent data structures, whence the General/SynchronizationPoints, General/DeadLock and General/LiveLock pages. I may well add more such to this site; I know of one frequent user of this site who would approve, and suspect others may exist. (Do contact me if so.)
* Language design.
* Wiki engine design ( see http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?General/PeriPeri ).


My main homepage is on General/MeatBall: http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?General/ChrisPurcell

*The way [we] perceive beauty is intimately related to our ability to process and understand complexity. A language that makes it hard to write elegant code makes it hard to write good code. -- Eric S. Raymond*

Thanks a lot for General/FoundationCollectionsAndInterfaceBuilder! Don't take the moron deleting your page as an indication of the general response to your nice classes! -- General/DavidRemahl

General/RobRix raises his glass in agreement.

Thanks, guys. -- General/KritTer

That seems the appropriate place to add this:
thanks very much, General/KritTer, for the very nice fix for the General/MultipleEditSyndrome. Yeah!!!

Please don't add to this list. It's mine.     :P
