Make sure you are running Project Builder and have your project open.  Double click on the "General/MainMenu.nib" file to open up Interface Builder.  In Interface Builder, go to the "General/MainMenu.nib" window and click on the "Classes" pane.  All classes you create are subclasses of already existing classes.  In this example, I show you how to create a subclass of General/NSObject, but you can use the same procedure to create subclasses of other classes.  Here it goes.  Highlight the word "General/NSObject" and hit enter.  This creates a subclass of the class "General/NSObject" now type in the name of the class you want to create.  Now go to the classes menu and choose "Instantiate General/MyController", where "General/MyController" is the name of the class you just created.  That is it.
