Robert P. Kuehne, in co-operation with J. D. Sullivan, has released a new book, "General/OpenGL Programming on Mac OS X".

General/OpenGL� Programming on Mac OS� X will be valuable to Mac programmers seeking to leverage General/OpenGL's power, General/OpenGL developers porting their applications to the Mac platform, and cross-platform graphics developers who want to take advantage of the Mac platform's uniquely intuitive style and efficiency.

The Mac has fully embraced General/OpenGL throughout its visual systems. In fact, Apple's highly efficient, modern General/OpenGL implementation makes Mac OS X one of today's best platforms for General/OpenGL development. General/OpenGL� Programming on Mac OS� X is the first comprehensive resource for every graphics programmer who wants to create, port, or optimize General/OpenGL applications for this high-volume platform.
Leading General/OpenGL experts Robert Kuehne and J. D. Sullivan thoroughly explain the Mac's diverse General/OpenGL General/APIs, both old and new. They illuminate crucial General/OpenGL setup, configuration, and performance issues that are unique to the Mac platform. Next, they offer practical, start-to-finish guidance for integrating key Mac-native General/APIs with General/OpenGL, and leveraging the full power of the Mac platform in your graphics applications.
Coverage includes
	•	A thorough review of Mac hardware and software architectures and their performance implications
	•	In-depth, expert guidance for accessing General/OpenGL from each of the Mac's core General/APIs: CGL, AGL, and Cocoa
	•	Interoperating with other Mac General/APIs: incorporating video with General/QuickTime, performing image effects with Core Image, and processing General/CoreVideo data
	•	Analyzing Mac General/OpenGL application performance, resolving bottlenecks, and leveraging optimizations only available on the Mac
	•	Detecting, integrating, and using General/OpenGL extensions
	•	An accompanying Web site (www.macopenglbook.com) contains the book's example code, plus additional General/OpenGL-related resources.
