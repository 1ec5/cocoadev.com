While Quartz (a.k.a. General/CoreGraphics) is Apple's 2D media library and General/OpenGL is Apple's chosen 3D media library, General/QuickTime is Apple's 4D (time-based) media library. While General/QuickTime's API is based on Carbon, it can largely be accessed by Cocoa apps for things like playing movies, loading graphic files, and playing MP3s via the General/QTKit framework.
