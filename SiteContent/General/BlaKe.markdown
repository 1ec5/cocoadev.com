I've been using a Mac since my SE/30, then [[PowerMac]] 6100/60 (still in service), and then a B&W G3 up till a few days ago when I added this Quicksilver [[GeeFour]] 1ghz Dual Proc.

Loved [[NeXT]] since the day I saw my first cube, did some minor tinkering with some [[NeXT]] machines in a lab I was involved in.

I've slowly learned bits about actual programming through many channels, first was C because of a MUD I was involved with, later about a year of Computer Science at the [[UofMN]], which included C, Java, and my favourite Scheme (Lisp). I also picked up Perl experience somewhere in there.

Since then I've really stuck to Java.  I don't do anything that requires real speed, save MP3 decoding and Database stuff, but that's what Cocoa and [[MySQL]] are for, right?

Java. Yuck. Java+Cocoa. Yuck yuck.
[[ObjC]]. Mm. [[ObjC]]+Cocoa. Yay! -- [[DavidRemahl]]

I see no reason why this site must be [[ObjectiveCee]] specific... -- [[MikeTrent]]

Nope, neither do I. However _I_ am strictly [[ObjC]] specific. At least when it comes to Cocoa. -- [[DavidRemahl]]

Scheme is the greatest!

Update by Blake, 11/3/2005:
And now as Apple has forsaken the Java Bridge... I'm doing everything in Python, a language I picked up since my first bio entry. So far the [[PyObjC]] bridge experience has been more promising than the Java Bridge ever felt it would be.
