I've been using a Mac since my SE/30, then General/PowerMac 6100/60 (still in service), and then a B&W G3 up till a few days ago when I added this Quicksilver General/GeeFour 1ghz Dual Proc.

Loved General/NeXT since the day I saw my first cube, did some minor tinkering with some General/NeXT machines in a lab I was involved in.

I've slowly learned bits about actual programming through many channels, first was C because of a MUD I was involved with, later about a year of Computer Science at the General/UofMN, which included C, Java, and my favourite Scheme (Lisp). I also picked up Perl experience somewhere in there.

Since then I've really stuck to Java.  I don't do anything that requires real speed, save MP3 decoding and Database stuff, but that's what Cocoa and General/MySQL are for, right?

Java. Yuck. Java+Cocoa. Yuck yuck.
General/ObjC. Mm. General/ObjC+Cocoa. Yay! -- General/DavidRemahl

I see no reason why this site must be General/ObjectiveCee specific... -- General/MikeTrent

Nope, neither do I. However _I_ am strictly General/ObjC specific. At least when it comes to Cocoa. -- General/DavidRemahl

Scheme is the greatest!

Update by Blake, 11/3/2005:
And now as Apple has forsaken the Java Bridge... I'm doing everything in Python, a language I picked up since my first bio entry. So far the General/PyObjC bridge experience has been more promising than the Java Bridge ever felt it would be.
