Describe General/DanielChmielewski here.

Beginning programmer, electrical engineering student at Mercer University, took a C++ class, but it was all procedural programming. Interested in starting my OOP experience with Cocoa. Right now, I need help with the simple stuff, like making my NIB files link with my code, but I will continue looking for the answers here. My e-mail is mercerdan@mac.com.
