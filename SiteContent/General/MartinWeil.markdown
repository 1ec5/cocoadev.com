OK, seems to work.

I really like Cocoa, but its not as easy as Basic but, you can do a lot more with it. I am currently working on a Prime Searcher Utility, but I have got a few dificulties in that, we�ll see.

You can look on my Website, but for now there is not a single Cocoa App there.

I have many [[RealBasic]] Projects, but only one is really finished, all other are not finished, or I know that nobody wants them.

You can download the finished one at:

It simply deletes the IE Download Cache, but it is only for Classic, sorry for that.

I don�t know where to post my Problems so I will do it here.

*Currently No Problems

Ah, don't you hate it when that happens? I have the solution for you, however. Create a new class, reference it from other classes, instantiate it in [[InterfaceBuilder]], and otherwise make use of it. Next, in the class' implementation, move the insertion point to a random line, and drop a cat on the keyboard repeatedly (adjust height as desired) until it compiles. You will have problems not only with animal rights activists, but also with the cat-code. You're saved!
