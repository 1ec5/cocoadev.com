I am working with General/PDFKit, using General/PDFAnnotations, to, well, annotate my General/PDFs.

However, it appears that only General/PDFAnnotationText sends the General/PDFViewAnnotationHitNotification notification.

This is a real pain, because I want to use General/PDFAnnotationSquare, but this appears not to send the 'hit' notification. 

So how can I tell when the user clicks my annotations?

Thanks thanks and thanks.
