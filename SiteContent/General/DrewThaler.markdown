[[UMich]] graduate. Co-created the [[DiscRecording]].framework at Apple. Worked in [[CoreOS]] filesystems. Now an alumni, doing mostly non-Mac filesystem code for game consoles. 

Decently experienced working with just about everything that has to do with [[CDs]] and [[DVDs]], including mass storage drivers, [[IOKit]], [[DiscRecording]], CD ripping, DVD playback, etc, though there are some things I'm better at or more up-to-date with than others. Been known to dabble a bit in [[QuickTime]]. Knows too much about [[AppleScript]]. Full of random knowledge about both OS9 and OSX.

Cocoa is the nth high-level application framework that I've used for real code, where n=6 or so. I've also used Java AWT and Swing, [[PowerPlant]], Think Class Libraries, and no real programmer's list would be complete without two different roll-your-owns that nobody has ever heard of and aren't worth mentioning here.
