General/UMich graduate. Co-created the General/DiscRecording.framework at Apple. Worked in General/CoreOS filesystems. Now an alumni, doing mostly non-Mac filesystem code for game consoles. 

Decently experienced working with just about everything that has to do with General/CDs and General/DVDs, including mass storage drivers, General/IOKit, General/DiscRecording, CD ripping, DVD playback, etc, though there are some things I'm better at or more up-to-date with than others. Been known to dabble a bit in General/QuickTime. Knows too much about General/AppleScript. Full of random knowledge about both OS9 and OSX.

Cocoa is the nth high-level application framework that I've used for real code, where n=6 or so. I've also used Java AWT and Swing, General/PowerPlant, Think Class Libraries, and no real programmer's list would be complete without two different roll-your-owns that nobody has ever heard of and aren't worth mentioning here.
