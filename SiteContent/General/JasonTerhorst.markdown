A regular here. Have used a number of the pages here to get things working in cocoa. Am very thankful to everyone who is responsible for putting stuff up here and keeping it running!

I'm more into graphic design and art than anything computer related, but Cocoa, once you get your feet wet, is so easy to use! I've worked on a couple apps to help me do the design-related things I want to do. Cocoa and [[AppleScript]] are easy enough that they put the power back into the hands of the users.

Site with various stuff at http://www.jterhorst.com. (I hope to put some free art and icons up eventually.)

April 2007: I just rec'd the email from Apple: I'm getting a WWDC scholarship! Whoohoo! This will be my first time going. Let me know if you'll be there, and want to meet up.
