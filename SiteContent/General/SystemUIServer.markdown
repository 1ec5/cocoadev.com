[[SystemUIServer]] runs the System Menu Bar.

Or at least the part on the right that handles [[NSMenuExtra]]<nowiki/>s and [[NSStatusItem]]<nowiki/>s (including the Spotlight menu). The part on the left is the application menu bar.

Other (not so important to Cocoa) duties that it takes care of include launching applications when [[CDs]] and [[DVDs]] are inserted, and putting up the dialog that says "You've inserted a blank CD, what would you like to do with it?"

If it crashes or is killed, it will automatically relaunch.
