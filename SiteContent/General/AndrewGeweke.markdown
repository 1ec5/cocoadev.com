I'm a fairly new Cocoa programmer after spending far, far too much of my life working on giant, very complex enterprise infrastructure stuff (think General/WebLogic, not apps that run on it). It was interesting and challenging, but less than satisfying. 

I like getting immediate, appealing results out of the machine, like Cocoa gives me.

Also, Objective-C is wonderfully freeing to my Java-addled mind. The fact that:

    
id x = ...
[x fooBar]


gives a compiler *warning*, not an *error* -- with the implications that brings about the language -- is wonderful.
