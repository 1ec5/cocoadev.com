I used General/NSColorPicker <General/NSColorPickingCustom> to create my custom color picker.
I added a slider for red, green and blue and text fields.
I also need two extra values (filter and transmit) and adding those to the color picker is no problem but getting those values in my subclass of General/NSColorWell is something else.

Is this possible at all or should look for something else?
