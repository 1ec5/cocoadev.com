Commonly known as gcc, the General/GnuCompilerCollection is what you and I (users of General/MacOSX) use to compiler our General/ObjC code into a nice, tidy, General/MachO binary.

It's also a very slow compiler by modern standards, and is getting worse every release. Apple have registered interest in doing some work to speed it up, and hopefully this will come to pass...
