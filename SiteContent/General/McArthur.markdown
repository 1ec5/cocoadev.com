The word "[[McArthur]]" is the last name of [[JakeMcArthur]].  That is, my father had it, my grandfather had it, my great-grandfather had it, all the way back to when it was given to my ancestors in Scotland.

........?

Let's traverse the family tree :-)
<code>
Father ''f = [self father];
while (f != nil)
{
    // weee, hey ancestor!
    f = [f father];
}</code>
