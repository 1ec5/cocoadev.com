I'm currently a network administrator. Actually, I've been working at the same company (in different positions) for almost ten years now. I'm also happily married. I'm pretty much a stable person, as you can probably tell. :)

Anyway, as far as programming goes, I've been writing programs for some time now. Let's see...that would be since 1983. It all started with an 8K Atari 400 with flat-panel keyboard, a cassette drive, and an ordinary television serving double-duty as a monitor . . . :)

Like most programmers, I've learned a lot of languages over the years, but I found one that was my favorite: C.  No, it's not object oriented.  And it'll let you produce some pretty messy code. But the language itself is just so darned elegant!  Despite learning various languages over the years and using some of them for pretty big projects, I still think best in C.

Because of my prediliction for C, though, I never did really get into GUI programming. I did a few small projects with Python and TK, but other than that my GUI programming experience was limited to a few experiments with Java/AWT, C/Xt, and C/GTK+. As of the end of 2001, if you'd have asked me if I'd ever be comfortable with programming GUI apps, I would have said, "No."

Then Mac OS X came to my attention.  It's Mac, so it's easy to use. And it's UNIX, so it's powerful and stable.  Being tired of fussing with Linux and General/FreeBSD (and long ago having given up on Microsoft), I decided to make the jump.  I figured I'd be able to just pick up on the same type of progamming I'd been doing all along (C, Python, Perl, etc.).  At worst, I knew I could give Java GUI programming another try, since it's built in to Mac OS X.

Little did I know...

After doing some research, I decided to try programming in the Mac's native language. I picked up a couple of books on Cocoa, as well as some stuff from Vervante/ADC on Mac OS X and Objective-C. After reading them and doing the exercises (esp. the Hillegass book), I realized that I could actually do this stuff: I could write GUI's in Mac's native language!

And, you know why?  It's mostly because Objective-C is just C with a few extensions. It's an absolutely fantastic language as far as I'm concerned. I get all my C goodness with some great object orientivity as well. It's sort of like Mac OS X itself: Apple ease of use with the power and stability of UNIX. With Mac and Objective-C/Cocoa, I got the best of all worlds.

I'm continuing to learn to program in Objective-C using the Cocoa General/APIs, and I'm having fun in the process.

I hope you're doing the same! :)
