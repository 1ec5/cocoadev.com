Apple's directory system for storing "network administrative information". It's where users, groups and other such things are stored in General/MacOSX 10.4 and earlier. The public interface for General/NetInfo is provided by General/OpenDirectory. General/NetInfo no longer exists in 10.5. See man 5 netinfo, and the nicl/niutil/nidump command-line utilities for more information.
