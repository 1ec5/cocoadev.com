Cocoa developer, wiki denizen([[PortlandPatternRepository]]/c2.com's [[WikiWikiWeb]]).

I practice almost-[[ExtremeProgramming]](can't go all-out, it's too hard to find a pair). 

My goals are to graduate high school, go to the Rochester Institute of Technology, and then teach at my current high school.
