Cocoa developer, wiki denizen(General/PortlandPatternRepository/c2.com's General/WikiWikiWeb).

I practice almost-General/ExtremeProgramming(can't go all-out, it's too hard to find a pair). 

My goals are to graduate high school, go to the Rochester Institute of Technology, and then teach at my current high school.

-General/JoeOsborn, of the fledgling Open Sword Group
