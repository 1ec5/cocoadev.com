I am looking for brazilian Cocoa programmers to join me on a big website I have been planning for the last 6 months, to be released on November. If you speak/write portuguese and know Cocoa or any of the programming languages below, please join me:

 
  * [[JavaScript]]
  * Objective-C
  * Java
  * [[RealBasic]]
  * Flash ([[ActionScript]])
  * DHTML
  * PHP
  * XML

Send an e-mail to nando_lucas@yahoo.com.br with your name and the programming languages you know.
As for [[CocoaDev]].com administrators and owners, I'm sorry to make this propaganda here, but I think every form of project that will increase our community is always welcome.
I'd be more than pleased to link to you on my upcoming website.
Than-Q
