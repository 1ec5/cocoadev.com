I am a network engineer for the educational sector within the Seattle/Puget Sound area.  I am also an instructor for a technical training center.  Most of my professional programming deals with parsing text files and analyzing bits that fly by on the network.  As a hobbyist, I started my Cocoa adventures writing small tools that help keep friends, family and coworkers out of the terminal as much as possible.

Remember back in Mac OS X 10.0 when sometimes things ended up in the trash that couldn't be deleted using Empty Trash.  Now imagine trying to guide a 73 year old grandmother to use terminal, cd, sudo, rm etc. via a long distance call (frightening)...oh...did I mention that she might not remember her admin password and you have to start with the password recovery process (can't get around that but now, if you need to help any of my relatives, the password is frankenpuss).

More recently, I have been involved in helping some friends design and build shareware and freeware apps for OS X.  Sometime in the future, you may find an app with a credit for me something like "Vice Imperial Chancellor of Junk Food Procurement" (just remember...we are the true movers and shakers).

My earliest programming experience was when I was just a tyke on a Timex Sinclair (does that date me?) programming BASIC.  Since then, I have learned Pascal, Fortran, C, C++, Perl, Java and countless other derivatives (is it just me or is C# like Java as if born in Redmond?).  You know the drill...step 1. learn language, step 2. solve specific problem, step 3. eject language from thy brain.

I've been programming in Cocoa since I first got wind that Apple had changed it's shopping list from [[BeOS]] to Next.  I purchased the one and only book I could find on [[NeXTSTEP]] programming three months before Rhapsody DP1 was released (not easy learning a programming process without the tools to play with).  Later, I installed Rhapsody and the Dev tools on a 9600 and took off from there.

I've used this site for quite some time now merely as a search tool to find answers to my questions (the [[WikiWikiWeb]] concept was alien to me until I recently sat down and figured out what the deal was).  Now I am happy that I am a giver as well as a receiver.

'''Interesting Fact #1:''' The Timex Sinclair had the BASIC keywords (print, goto, if) in small orange print on the keys of the keyboard.  So if you wanted to type 10 print "Hello World", you would type the 10 and then hold down the orange function-key and press 'P' and the word 'print' would show on the screen.  Do to a lack of a sophisticated tokenizer, you could not do it any other way.  Typing the individual letters of the 'print' statement would give an error.
