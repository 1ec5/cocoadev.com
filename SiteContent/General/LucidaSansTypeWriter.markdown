General/LucidaSansTypeWriter is a monospaced font present on my system, it is very similar to Monaco, but comes in both bold and italic. Unfortunately it would seem that none of my friends have this font -- one of them found it as 'additional fonts' on the second install CD, but I have just re-installed a system with Panther (developer preview), and the font seems to be gone.

Anyone have any details on this font? Why is it only optionally installed, and why does it seem to be removed again with Panther? Considering how slow the system is to soft-render both and/or italic, not to mention that most parts of Cocoa doesn't even support that, then Apple really ought to give us a monospaced font with these features.

Might it have been installed by something else? I know Photoshop can install a ton of fonts. -- General/RobRix

Apple has never shipped this font. And it is not free either, so very hard to find online. But if you look long and hard enough, you will find it...

I think mine stems from my friends install disk #2 from Jaguar, at least I didn't get it with any 3rd party software (since I have none). It was in the General/AdditionalFonts.pkg -- he is away right now, but I will check when he returns.
