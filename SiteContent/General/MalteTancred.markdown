Started my programming career on the General/NeXT in 1994. Recent years has been mostly General/WebObjects and, as is the case for General/PeterLindberg, Cocoa programming is mostly a spare time activity.

I have a blog at http://tancred.com/malte/blog/ (english) and http://tancred.com/malte/reflekterar/ (swedish). See ya!
