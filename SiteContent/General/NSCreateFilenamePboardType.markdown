I just found General/NSCreateFilenamePboardType in General/NSPasteboard.h but also realised it is partly described in the Functions section of the General/AppKit documentation.

So if I only accept e.g. png pictures to be dropped on my program, I would use it with "png" and filter on that type, and the system is smart enough to give me the normal General/NSFilenamePboardType's which represent files ending with .png?
