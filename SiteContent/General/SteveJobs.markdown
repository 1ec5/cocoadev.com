Steve Jobs is the CEO and co-founder of General/AppleComputer. He also founded General/NeXT and Pixar Animation Studios (those 3D Disney movies like Toy Story) while he was not working for Apple. According to General/BookCocoaProgMacOSX, Steve was demoted until he left, but when General/NeXT was bought by Apple he got himself back on top.

The man with the Reality Distortion Field.
Commonly sighted wearing jeans and a turtleneck, although recently he has also been spotted wearing a suit.

Approach with caution, as he claims to be a card-carrying visionary.

The man on the left in the bottom picture, by the way, is Dan Kottke,  one of Jobs' supposed friends, who got screwed without any stock options and left behind, though I've heard he's remarkably unbitter about the experience.

Here's what he looks like today, as if you didn't know.

I can highly recommend the movie Pirates of Silicon Valley: http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0168122/

Btw: anybody knows what the deal is about Steve only making $1 a year at Apple (but getting stocks/stock options), I mean, what puts food in his table (does he have millions in cash from selling General/NeXT)?

*He's also CEO of Pixar, and I imagine he has quite a bit saved up from his first tenure at Apple.*

There are other ways to be compensated for your work than to take a salary. And if you're lucky enough to afford to take only $1/year, that arrangement can be very useful. The income tax you pay on $1/year is quite manageable. It's tough for critics to argue that you're salary is excessive. Stockholders often like top execs to be compensated with stock as that tends to align the interest of the executives with those of the stockholders. Etc.

"(does he have millions in cash from selling General/NeXT)?"

General/NeXT was bought by General/AppleComputer for $400 million. Now I'm sure not all of it went to him, but I'd say quite a bit did!
