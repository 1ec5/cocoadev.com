I'm looking for a primer or a forum as good as General/CocoaDev for understanding how to build my own USB based hardware, how to write the driver for it, and eventually how to write the General/CocoaApp that will control the hardware.  The hardware isn't incredibly complex -- in fact, I just want to make calls that turn switches on and off... anybody know of a good place to get started?

Is it hopeless?
