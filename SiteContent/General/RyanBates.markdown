I first gained interest in programming when I turned 11. After attempting to learn C (why did I start there?) I gave up and decided to create a personal website in HTML. A couple years later I learned to create dynamic web-pages through scripting, first by using an uncommon language called Web DNA, and then later learning PHP and General/MySQL.

I started playing around with General/RealBasic around the year 2000 and started learning Cocoa shortly thereafter. I am sold on Cocoa, it has been the most enjoyable programming environment that I have ever experienced.

**Current Projects**


* An inner-office messaging application (cross between e-mail and instant messaging).
* A pluggable batch file processing utility.

Whoa, sorta creepy how similar you are to me... I started off in HTML, then C, then RB, then Cocoa, and I unicycle, juggle, play piano too... haha --General/KevinWojniak

*Cool, I wonder if juggling is a popular hobby for many computer programmers? There were four club jugglers at the campus bash party at WWDC 2004 which I thought was interesting. -- General/RyanBates*

Is it because of the ability among most to analyze information (math, geometry, etc) quickly, and good reflexes that we programmers are known for? Ah, I kid, I kid. -- General/JasonTerhorst
