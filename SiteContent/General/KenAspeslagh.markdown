[[KenAspeslagh]] is a Mac programmer and currently a huge fan of Cocoa.  

I love [[ReverseEngineering]] and [[ApplicationEnhancer]].  If programs don't do what I want them to do then I change them.

I work for [[EcammNetwork]]. ( http://www.ecamm.com )  We make random Mac and Palm software, many of them being Palm [[DevTools]].

Currently, my most popular distributions are iGlasses and iChatUSBCam are iChat AV plugins.
