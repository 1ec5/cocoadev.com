Cocoa developer currently situated in Sweden, of northern Europe. When I'm done with my exams in about 2 months, I'll finally going to get all the time I want to code. For now I only have time to maintain a few minor projects:

General/CanCombineIcons - General/ClosedSource icon creation tool. Uses the General/IconFamily class by Troy Stephens, to which I have also contributed my changes. General/CanCombineIcons 2.1.0 was awarded Runner-up in the Student category of the Apple Design Awards at this year's WWDC! Thanks Apple and congratulations to the other winners/runner-ups!

Sno Screensaver - (should really be spelled as Snï¿½) Screen saver/app bundle. Makes snow flakes falling over the screen. Lots of configuration to be made, and source is open :)      http://www.ittpoi.com/sno.html

Cocoa Fortune - Trivial wrapper for fortune, with some fun effects. General/OpenSource and free. http://www.ittpoi.com/fortune.html

Clock Ling - Pseudo-discontinued dockling showing a clock. Leaky and doesn't run under 10.1...I _will_ try to udate it some day, though.

General/GothenburgStudiecirkel - Cocoa study group in the Swedish city of Gothenburg.
