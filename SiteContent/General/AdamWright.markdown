Another General/BloodyAussieCocoaDevUser<nowiki/>, I've been programming "srsly" since around 1997, at which point I would have been around 16. I got into programming Macs around 2005 during an extended jaunt studying not-very-seriously at The University of Western Australia. Now I work at the uni in a web-development capacity and dabble as much as possible with Cocoa in my spare time.

I'm fairly into genetic algorithm-ey stuff and approached it with a General/PowerBook G4 toward the end of my degree. I'm heavily into evolution and emergence in general, and enjoy talking to anyone else who can speak the language, so hit me up some time if you've got a project in mind :D

Oh. And I'm not a big fan of garbage collection.
