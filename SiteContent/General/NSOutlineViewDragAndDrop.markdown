Hi All,


I am trying to implement drag and drop in General/NSOutlineView.

I have create General/NSOutlineView connected it through Interface Builder.
I have also set its delegate.
and then I registered the type of drag.
then I implem writeRows , validateDrop & dropaccept Method.
But When I drap a row, control only goes to General/WriteRows and it is not going inside General/ValidateDrop and accept because of which I am not able to drop row.
Any kind of help would b appreciated.


Thanks
Sourabh
