New to Cocoa, OS X and Objective C.  My first real project is an Objective-C implementation of FIT, http://fit.c2.com/wiki.cgi?[[ObjectiveCeePlatform]]

I'll be joining a trial run for a Master of Software Arts in January, which I'm looking forward to very much.  I'm considering workshopping my Objective C implementation of FIT.

Number one on my wish list of new features for this wiki is a diff function, to show clearly the changes from one edit of a page to another. See for example http://c2.com/cgi/quickDiff?[[StevenNewton]]
