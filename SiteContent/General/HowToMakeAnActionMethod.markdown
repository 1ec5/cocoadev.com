Here is the meat of Objective-C programming!  Here is how you create an action method using General/XCode.  For an action method to work, you must

* declare your action method in the header file (.h) - see General/HowToDeclareAnActionMethod,
* write the code for the action method in the implemenation file (.m) - see General/HowToFillAnActionMethodWithCode,
* call the action method.  This can be done by linking the action method to a button (see General/HowToLinkAButtonToAnActionMethod) or menu item or by calling the action method from another method or another class.  Also, some methods (such as drawRect:) will get called automatically, so you don't have to worry about calling them.


Make sure also to tell Interface Builder about changes you have made to the class in General/XCode - see General/HowToReadHeaderFilesFromProjectBuilderIntoInterfaceBuilder.
