Hello everyone.

I am getting desperate. I need to somehow figure out the selection ranges in a General/NSTextField/General/NSTokenField. The "slash" part is why I can't use General/NSTextView, where it's really easy to get the selection ranges. After hours of figuring out, I found out how to add the tokens to the token field and now I should give up? :( Isn't there a workaround?

TIA - Krystof
