Like General/RubyCocoa, but for Python... 

... uh, no, General/RubyCocoa came well after General/PythonCocoa.   In particular, General/PyObjC was started in 1994 and has been in various states of active ever since.  Recently, development on General/PyObjC has been very active and a 1.0 was released (Fall 2003).  You can develop full featured Cocoa applications using Python, including subclassing Objective-C in Python and full fledged support for NIB files.
