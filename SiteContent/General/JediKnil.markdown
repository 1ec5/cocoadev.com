I used to be active on this site in the mid 2000s. I was a teenager then, and it's...um...''interesting'' to look back at the posts on this site and see my ideologies change, as well as occasional moments of obnoxious. I apologize for the latter.

Today (as of this edit) I work for Apple on the Clang compiler and static analyzer.

Programmer since age 8-, real name Jordy Rose.

http://www.belkadan.com. Home of Belkadan Software, a small open-source freeware company (and running on my own server at home ''grin'').

The flagship product seems to be '''Dockyard''', a "dock switcher" that comes in three forms: menu extra, widget, and application. If anyone is interested in integrating Dockyard's functions into your application somehow, I've also made a static library that can access Dockyard's core preferences and receives notifications when the dock is changed; just e-mail me if you want it.

Then there's '''[[GenericToolbar]]''', an [[NSToolbar]] [[IBPalette]] for developers only. This one hasn't taken off like either of the others, but recently I saw it mentioned on a few other developers' blogs, which is cool. Leopard is supposed to support toolbars in IB, so I'll probably eventually tie off [[GenericToolbar]] by making it compatible with both nib formats.

Finally, there's '''Webmailer''', which fixes those pesky mailto: links to open your own webmail compose page. It works with several different webmail services from Gmail to Roundcube, although really it's just a glorified URL rewriter. But it works nicely and it's the most mainstream product I've released so far.

In theory there's a blog on the Belkadan site, but I haven't really gotten into updating it much yet.

Product Concepts: There's '''D<nowiki/>ocYouMeant''', a documentation generator like [[HeaderDoc]] or javadoc. It will eventually support both Java and Objective C, although it will likely not be very compatible with other documentation tools. Currently it works but not well enough to actually release to anyone; the code really has to be scrapped and rebuilt from the bottom up for a good program. There's also '''AXE''', an XML editor that I really don't need and thus probably won't ever be finished (unless I'm REALLY bored).

The blog I mentioned earlier is actually using PHP-based software of my own creation as well, '''B<nowiki/>logAgain'''. I don't know if this will ever be release-status either, but it is getting closer and closer to being a successful forum-blog hybrid. Still working on feature-completion, though, and it'll be a long time before it's actually released.

At some point I'm planning to create my own programming language, '''Jawa''', with a structure similar to Java and Objective C (the two languages I know best). It's more an exercise in language design than something I expect to use, but...anyway it may end up never actually being implemented.

If you were wondering, Knil was originally Link backwards (the guy from the Legend of Zelda games), and also (occasionally) K'nil, a dragonrider-like name (from the Dragonriders of Pern series by Anne M<nowiki/>cCaffrey). Jedi, obviously, is Star Wars. (If it's not "obviously," go watch A New Hope at the very least.)
