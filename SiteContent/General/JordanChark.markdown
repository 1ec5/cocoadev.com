I've been working with code on Windows, the web, and now OS X for a couple of years now, and am fluent in several related languages. These are: C/C#/C++/Obj. C (Cocoa implementation), COBOL, Python, Ruby, LISP, [[ActionScript]], Fortran, Java, Pascal, Basic/[[QBasic]]/[[LibertyBasic]]/[[DarkBasic]], CSS, XHTML, Javascript, XUL/XML, SQL.

I'm also fairly proficient in Quartz as well as other OS X core technologies requiring an API of sorts.

Contact me if you're interested in working on something in collaboration.
