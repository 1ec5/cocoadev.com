Laat ik gewoon brutaal hier in het Nederlands typen. Wie weet wie dat ziet :-). Ik ben nu in het laatste hoofdstuk van [[BookLearningCocoaObjCSecond]]. En al voorzichtig wat aan het experimenteren. 


what did I use for learning so far?

For those wanting to learn Cocoa / Objective-C without any knowledge of C, Seth Roby wrote tutorials with just the amount of C required to be able to learn Objective-C. Unfortunately he didn't finish his series, but I found that these gave me a very good start. [[XCode]] gets introduced as well.

Introduction  http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2003/07/22/cocoa_series.html 
Functions  http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2003/08/01/cocoa_series.html
Flow control  http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2003/08/19/cocoa_series.html
Loops  http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2003/09/09/cocoa_series.html
Variables  http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2003/10/07/cocoa.html
Variable types  http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2004/01/13/cocoa.html

For a quick start with Interface Builder: Currency Converter (the 'Hello World' of Cocoa, it seems)
http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/[[ObjCTutorial]]/index.html

Now that I had some basics, it was time for some more info on object oriented programming
http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/[[ObjectiveC]]/index.html

All this for free. But I realized I had to invest some money to get further, so I bought [[BookLearningCocoaObjCSecond]]. It was really helpful to have worked through all of the above, to understand this book better. The basis in C as acquired through Seth Roby's incomplete set of columns is somewhat weak though, but I found this site
http://www.iota-six.co.uk/c/default.asp
where I can look up anything C that I don't know.
