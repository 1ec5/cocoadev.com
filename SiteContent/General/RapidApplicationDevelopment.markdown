General/RapidApplicationDevelopment (RAD) is the process of creating an application from a prototype (e.g., General/AppKit & Foundation), modifying as needed, instead of writing new code. A true RAD workflow includes a GUI design tool (General/InterfaceBuilder).

General/NeXTComputer shook the computing world with the introduction of RAD in the early 90's, and continues to innovate with Cocoa.
