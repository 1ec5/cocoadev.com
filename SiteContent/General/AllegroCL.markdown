Franz Inc. [http://www.franz.com/] has been developing Allegro Common Lisp for many years.  A trial version is
available  http://www.franz.com/downloads/

Allegro Common Lisp, General/CLisp, ECLS and MCL have no Cocoa interface, so there is no point listing them here. The only Lisp environments with Cocoa interfaces are General/LispWorks (commercial) and  General/OpenMCL (free) --- at the present time. (Ah, okay. Cool. We'll leave it here, so we can fill in more information later. ;-) )
