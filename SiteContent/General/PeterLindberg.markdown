I've worked with General/AppKit since late 1994. Nowadays, we don't get that many non-General/WebObjects projects, unfortunately, so if I program under Cocoa it's in my spare time.

I'm a fan of General/ExtremeProgramming and General/MalteTancred and I have put together the General/ObjcUnit testing framework.

I have wiki pages at http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?General/PeterLindberg, http://oops.se/cgi-bin/wiki?General/PeterLindberg and I have a blog at http://tesugen.com.
