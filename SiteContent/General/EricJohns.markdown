I am 16 years old and I live in Maryland. I started Cocoa programming in April of 2006, and so I guess you could say I'm a newbie. I own an Intel Core Solo Mac mini and a [[NeXTstation]] Turbo Color with 128 MB of RAM. I wrote a word processor a while ago using Objective-C/Cocoa, and using the Sparkle framework for updates. I like some rock music. My favorite TV show of ''all'' would have to be Life on Mars (the original - not the crappy ABC remake). Another show I watch is Eureka, which airs on the Sci Fi Channel. I like Monty Python's Flying Circus. I think that Pixar films, ''especially'' WALLï¿½E are some of the best coming out these days. I'm also interested in filmmaking.

I know Objective-C/Cocoa, [[AppleScript]], bash script, (X)HTML, and XML. Feel free to contact me with any questions through the email address above.
