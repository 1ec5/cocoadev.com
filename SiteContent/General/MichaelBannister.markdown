Having done 2 years' maths and 1 year of Computer Science at the University of Cambridge, I am hoping to spend some time this summer getting to grips with Cocoa before I start work in September.  I've read Kochan's General/BookProgInObjC and am working through Hillegass's General/BookCocoaProgMacOSX (both *excellent* books for newcomers, IMO).

I'm hoping to contribute to the newsreader General/OSXnews [http://osxnews.sourceforge.net/] and any other projects that catch my eye.
