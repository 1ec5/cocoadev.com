Because there is little in the way of API documentation for the General/OmniFrameworks, and some of the classes are rather large and opaque (and powerful!), I've undertaken to add as much documentation about the General/OmniFrameworks as I can to General/CocoaDev. Please contribute what you know so that the barrier to using these frameworks is lower. They can add a lot to a software project!

Also, please add your name if you've contributed documentation about the General/OmniFrameworks:

Anyone working on this still? It's still very needed.
