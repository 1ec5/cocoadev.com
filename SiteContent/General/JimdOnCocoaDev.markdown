New guy here.

I'm just breaking into MACOSX/Objective-C/Cocoa. I have many years experience as a programmer and as I learn I intend to share. I am currently interested in General/OpenGl programmming on the MAC.

I have now posted some of my codes on http://www.surfnetusa.com/jimd

There are two examples for General/OpenGL. Check it out.
