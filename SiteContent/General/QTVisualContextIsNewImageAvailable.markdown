Hello. I need to get frames out of streaming media source (rtp). The stream is perfectly playable with General/QuickTime Player, but not with General/QTMovie. With General/QTMovie I got only three or five frames of video, while audio works perfectly, after video freezes. I got QTCoreVideo101 and replace initialize of General/QTMovie from file to initialization with NSURL.

Please help!
