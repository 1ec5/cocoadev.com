Hi All, I've been attempting to use a custom cell within the General/NSBrowser but so far I have been unsuccessful. I subclassed General/NSCell, and called this on the General/NSBrowser:
    
[mainBrowser setCellClass:[jazzTrackerCell class]];

I've attempted the setCellPrototype: method and allocating jazzTrackerCell with no luck either. The browser doesn't use the custom cell at all!
How do I go about using a custom cell in the General/NSBrowser? Thanks!

----

I have some code which uses custom cells in an General/NSBrowser. Here is my code in awakeFromNib:

    
  General/CustomCell* thePrototype = General/[[[CustomCell alloc] init] autorelease];
  General/self theBrowser] setDelegate:[self theDataSource;
  General/self theBrowser] setCellPrototype:thePrototype];
  [[self theBrowser] setMatrixClass:[[[BrowserMatrixView class]];


The "General/CustomCell" class has General/NSBrowserCell as a superclass. Not sure you need to have a custom matrix class - it's for drag and drop and right clicking on the cells (see General/RightClickSelectInBrowser). Let me know if you need any more code - General/DavidThorpe.

This is probably the same problem as General/CustomSegmentedControls.

----
To paraphrase from the General/CustomSegmentedControls page, unless you've created and loaded an IB palette for your custom cell and control, IB doesn't know about them when it archives your nib.  It archives whatever +cellClass returns.  Even if you provide a custom class in the Inspector, without a palette IB can only call +cellClass on the version you dragged into the nib, since the code for your custom control isn't loaded.  General/[[NSSegmentedControl] cellClass] returns General/NSSegmentedCell, so that's the class that IB archives in the nib.

The way you go about fixing it involves overriding your control's -initWithCoder: method to temporarily modify how the General/NSKeyedUnarchiver unpacks your control -- this will only work for 10.2+ nibs.  When General/NSNib unloads your control, it calls this method.  So you tell the General/NSKeyedArchiver which you're passed that whenever it sees "General/NSSegmentedCell" to unpack "General/MyCustomSegmentedCell" instead.  Then you call [super initWithCoder:coder] and swap the archiver back to using the standard General/NSSegmentedCell.

----
Note that for pre-10.2 nibs the same technique can be applied using General/NSUnarchiver methods. However I really hope that nobody here is forced to deal with pre-10.2 nibs anymore.
----
David that code worked without a hitch! I didn't find the need to alter the unarchiving methods of the nib. Perfect! Thankyou very much.

Is there anyway to achieve varying row heights in the General/NSBrowser like you can do with General/NSTableView ï¿½ tableView:heightOfRow: Does it require the cells to be subclassed?

----
General/NSBrowser is implemented using a bunch of General/NSMatrix views. Unfortunately General/NSMatrix doesn't seem to allow varying row heights, but if you were going to subclass something, that would be it.
----
I decided to use General/NSTableView, and imitate the behaviour of the browser. It worked out well. Thankyou!
