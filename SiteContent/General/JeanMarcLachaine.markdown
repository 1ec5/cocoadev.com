Background

Started life as a geek, rebelled, spent lots of years "In The Wind", came full circle back to blessed geekdom.

Recent convert to Apple. 

Learning Cocoa as a step towards creating physical simulations that can display game-like graphics of the systems being modelled. I am currently building a math and physics framework to that end.

Is 'in the wind' an idiom in another language?  It doesn't mean anything in english.

----Perhaps he meant "in the wild"?

I meant "In The Wind". It most cetainly is an idiom. Moreover, it is an idiom in the common english vernacular spoken by those who have led or are still living that life. I'm feeling a little generous in terms of explanations today so I'll provide enough information for you to figure it out. Think of the relationship between "leather, chrome, and Steppenwolf". Just in case the last term doesn't ring a bell, it is the name of a band from the early part of my youth.
