General/OpenGLScript is going to be a basic scripting language for the beginner General/OpenGL programmer. This language will allow you to play with General/OpenGL calls without having to recompile every time you want to see the effects of changing a single parameter. 

I'm going to provide an object that can interpret General/OpenGLScript and output the interpretation to source. This source code will be compatible with Cocoa's implementation of General/OpenGL. The interpreter will also be able to load an General/OpenGLScript dynamically so you can modify scripts and view the effects of the modifications on the fly (while the General/OpenGL context is open). --zootbobbalu

Hey, this is cool. It'd be great combined with a little prototyping environment so you could play around in a single running app.
