Another interesting private framework that's included with Safari. A quick [[ClassDump]] reveals it has to do with non-graphical parts of web access- I just took a quick look, and I'd guess it is something like [[OWFramework]]. If you want to take a look at the interfaces, I uploaded it at http://www.atommic.com/software/hacking/[[WebFoundation]].h .
