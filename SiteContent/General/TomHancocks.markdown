Hi,

I have been programming in Objective-C for just over 4 years now, and am working on projects for both the Mac and iPhone. I work freelance, and regularly experiment around with things to find new, better or quicker ways of doing things. 

I have also found in my 4 years using Objective-C that there could be a lot more stuff done in the area of Sockets and communication across [[LANs]]. Current support is nice, but is a nightmare to get to grips with (or maybe I was looking in the wrong places). Perhaps some nice wrappers to encompass it all ([[NetServices]], [[NSFileHandle]], etc) in a easy to setup way would be a nice addition to Cocoa... hmm, that gives me an idea.

My major applications are:
- [[TuneBar]]
- File Actions

[[TuneBar]] has been reviewed in [[MacFormat]] UK and was named Shareware of the Month for March, 2008 in issue 193 and awarded 4 out of 5 stars. It has also been featured in iCreate UK, though not as a review, but a double page article.

Hi, Tom - I started in OS X with [[REALbasic]] and found the same thing. Toolbars, drag-n-drop, printing layout ... all too difficult to do gracefully in OS X. Stick with Cocoa/Obj-C - your users will thank you for it! :-) -j

Hehe, I most definitely agree.  I think when you look at what cocoa is capable compared to something like rb... the difference is astronomical.  If you're doing OS X, you're doing cocoa.  If you try to do it in rb, you end up faking OS X.

Yeah, well i have only been doing it a few days, and it just already feels so much nicer, though it will still take a while to move from RB completely --[[TomHancocks]]

Talk to us 6 months from now. RB makes easy stuff easy, but hard stuff damn near impossible! ;-) You'll be at your RB level and probably beyond in that time, provided you stick with Cocoa during those six months. -j
