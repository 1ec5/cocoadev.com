I'm a long-time Mac user starting with a Mac+ and then moving up the line including a few Performas, a Quadra, and SE, and my latest, a [[GeeFour]] Ti-book. I also got my start with computer consulting with a Mac doing Supercard, and C programming with Think-C. 

I am also an instructor in Jeet Kune Do (Martial art by Bruce Lee)  in Toronto,Canada. My website can be found at http://www.sphereofinfluence.ca
