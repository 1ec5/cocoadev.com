Been programming a long time, RB mostly, but I can do Java, Applescript Studio, PHP, General/MySQL, C, and I've been doing Objective-C lately. I've used other languages, but they're not important.General/ScotiaSoft Systems - www.scotiasoft.com - hosted by General/AmbitiousLemon.Mac.halodev.org - mac.halomods.com - hosted by Grenadiac. I wrote HMT there.

Let's leave the name-calling and page-defacing to other sites where this sort of immaturity is acceptable. It has no place here. Violators will be placed on the General/WikiSpam page for blacklisting. *Not that I approve of name calling, but it isn't spam.  I don't think you have the authority to make this threat.*The beauty of posts like these is that you never know *who* made them. My suggestion would be just to knock it off so you don't have to find out.

I'm not sure what name-calling or page-defacing went on here... but I bet it had to do with the fact that I accidentally linked to the wrong site. My website used to be www.scotiasoft.com, but it was bought out from under me by a disgusting porn site. Now, it is www.scotiasoft.com. My bad.

Happened again. Maybe you should try a different host?

Or perhaps you should sue the hell out of the registrar you used to register your domain! Personally, if my business domain were mishandled like that, I'd see to it that that little mishap was my ticket to wealth!!

Just deleted a ton of spam from this page. It's obvious it's a bot, because the edit page becomes a difficult-to-read lump of text. --General/JasonTerhorst
