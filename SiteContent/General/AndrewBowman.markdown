**Andrew Bowman is:**


* a CSC graduate of Cal Poly State University, CA.  Woo!
* programming struts web apps for EDS in Seaside, CA
* a green belt in Shaolin Kenpo
* a C++ journeyman, a Java ninja, and an Obj-C/Cocoa strategist
* not quite sure what that last line really means, but thinks it sounds cool anyway



**Past projects:**

* **Undercurrent** - My senior project, a Bonjour chat client capable of communicating with iChat and sporting a Quartz Composer UI with an ocean/aquarium theme.  Finished, but no aquarium  =(.



**General/CocoaDev contributions:**

* **General/IFVerticallyExpandingTextField** - Like iChat's input field, expands and contracts when it resizes and as you type



**Career interests:**
Application engineering and design is my calling.  I'm a hopeless pattern junkie, addicted to polymorphism and interfaces, and get my fix by creating maintainable and extensible software.  My tastes run toward OO languages, such as Java and Objective-C, though C# is looking mighty tempting.  I'm taking a stronger interest in testing, now that I'm in the industry, and am fascinated with mock objects, General/JMock in particular.  I work well with teams as long as team communication is open and open minded.  

Dream job:  Working on just about any Cocoa app at Apple.
