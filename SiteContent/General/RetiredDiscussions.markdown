Discussions that have been retired. See General/RetiredVsActiveDiscussions.  To retire a discussion, change its ENTRY to General/RetiredDiscussions instead of General/CocoaDiscussions.

When retiring a discussion, do consider whether it needs to remain a discussion or if you can file it in a more useful place on General/CocoaDev (perhaps after refactoring to winnow the useful information from the chaff). Discussions are tedious to extract information from, and this page is a bit of a backwater.
