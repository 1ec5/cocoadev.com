I work on the French correction and language reference application Antidote http://antidote.info/ at Druide informatique inc. http://druide.com/

Before Cocoa, I had the pleasure and pain of working with Carbon ([[PowerPlant]]), Win32 (MFC, C++Builder), [[NeXTstep]] (ca. 1995), and X11 ([[OpenLook]], Motif). I don't have any desire to go back.
