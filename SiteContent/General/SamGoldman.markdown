I started using Cocoa and Objective-C when OS X came out. I never used [[NeXT]], but I want to buy some black hardware at some time in the future.

I am currently working on an open source project for connecting to [[MySQL]] servers with Cocoa. It should be a fun project and everyone is welcome to help out. You can find out more here:

I have a variety of interests including:

* Programming
* Web Page Design (usu. with PHP)
* Math & Physics
* Running (Cross Country and Distance Track)
* Linux Administration


I am 17 and live in California, across the bay from San Francisco.
