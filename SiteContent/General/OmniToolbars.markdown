When using General/OmniWeb, and other General/OmniApps, I noticed a few differences between General/OmniToolbars, and General/AppKit General/NSToolbar.

Please Explain this.

*What sort of differences? Please explain that.*

Ok,.. The you click the toggle toolbar button, instead of smoothly toggling it just appears toggled.
