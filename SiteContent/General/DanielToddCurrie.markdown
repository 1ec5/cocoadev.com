Hi, I write some Cocoa/Objective-C software and stuff; I'm not extraordinarily good at it yet.

I've written a couple of open source cocoa classes/frameworks:

[[DTCPathView]] - It allows the programmer to easily add auto-completion of absolute path strings to any [[NSTextField]]. 

[[DTCVersionManager]] - It allows the programmer to easily add version management to their OS X application, using a simple online XML file containing version information.
