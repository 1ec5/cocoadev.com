The [[UserInterface]] is the part of an application with which the user interacts.

For typical Mac OS X applications, the [[UserInterface]] will be a [[GraphicalUserInterface]] with windows and menus and such, but those aren't the only kind of interfaces available.

Most UNIX tools use the [[CommandLineInterface]], which you can access from the Terminal application. This is generally more complex for the user, but it can be useful when you need to provide a basic [[UserInterface]] for a tool that normally runs without interaction.

There are other kinds of interfaces available as well. Things like [[SpeechRecognition]] provide a [[UserInterface]] that can be appropriate in some situations.

[[AppleScript]] is also a sort of [[UserInterface]].
