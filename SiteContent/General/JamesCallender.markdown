Recovering cocoa addict!

Starting developing in the 4th grade using Hypercard.  Later read "Learn C on the Mac" by Dave Mark but decided to move to Java.  Developed with that for a while but eventually got around to dabbling in the Mac [[ToolBox]].  Then came the day [[MacOSX]] rolled around and I have been developing in Cocoa/Objective-C ever since - I became addicted.

Currently working on Cantrip, a Cocoa-based MUD client for OSX (I believe it was the first - yey!) and Wisp, a shell script editor (though I have adapted it for many different languages).  Also working with [[DarylHawes]] on other projects like [[LogOutAE]], and Cocoa Mapre.

That's creepy - I have "Learn C on the Macintosh" right in front of me! (I read it a long time ago, but took it out today to take a look at it again) --[[BobInDaShadows]]
