I have worked for The Voyager Company on CD-ROM titles such as Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, the Voyager Video Stack and children's titles.  I have worked at Kaleida on developing a Directory Translation Kit for [[ScriptX]].  

I currently work on an open source e-book project, developed in Squeak/Smalltalk, called Sophie (http://www.sophieproject.org/ ).

I operate Geeks R Us (http://www.geeksrus.com/ ) and develop the iPhoto export plugin, [[BetterHTMLExport]]  (http://www.geeksrus.com/software/betterhtmlexport/ ), original developed by Drooling Cat (http://www.droolingcat.com/ ).
