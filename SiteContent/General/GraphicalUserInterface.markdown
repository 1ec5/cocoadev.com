The General/GraphicalUserInterface (or GUI for short) is the general term for all the things that a typical Mac OS X application presents in its General/UserInterface: things like windows, buttons, and menus are all considered to be elements of a General/GraphicalUserInterface.

An OS X application and its General/GraphicalUserInterface should General/JustWork, although this is General/EasierSaidThanDone. Note also that it is easier said that it is "easier said than done" than it is done.
