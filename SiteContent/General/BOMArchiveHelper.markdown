General/BOMArchiveHelper is a core service that provides the mechanism behind the "Create Archiveï¿½" contextual menu in the Finder. It was introduced in Panther. Note that there are other libraries for zip compression available in OS X, and that General/BOMArchiveHelper is not well documented. The zip archives it produces have a proprietary method, similar to General/AppleDouble, for preserving resource forks and other HFS metadata. As of this writing only General/BOMArchiveHelper and General/StuffIt 9 support it, but the archives can be opened with any other unzip program to access only the data forks.
