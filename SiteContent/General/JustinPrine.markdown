Professionally I work as the project manager on the Classroom Performance System for Mac and as a test lead on CPS for Windows at eInstruction Corp. ( http://www.einstruction.com/ )

My spare time is consumed with icon design, user interface design, user experience design, and programming. The majority of my programming experience is with Cocoa/Java/C++/XHTML+CSS/PHP/Ruby/[[REALbasic]]. I am also currently finishing my bachelors degree in CS at the University of North Texas in the DFW area.

If you are in need of icons, disk image art, or other user interface design then get in touch and let's work together to create something beautiful and usable.
