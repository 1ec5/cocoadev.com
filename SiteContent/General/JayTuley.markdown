James Tuley a.k.a Jay Tuley

I have a B.S. from UIUC and of my coursework there my favorite subjects were the high level stuff like [[DesignPattern]] and User Interface Design and ones that had fun MP's like core programing classes and AI. I did all my course work on a Mac without trouble since I started my freshman year when OS X PB was released. Had some interesting projects which I worked on with my friends and classmates such as [[TrailBlazer]] and [[MusicRecommendation]] and [[ThreeDeeOhEssTen]].  On my own I've been working on a [[MusicBrainz]] client for Mac, called [[IEatBrainz]] and Borderlees Cocoa [[QuickTime]] Player called [[NicePlayer]].
