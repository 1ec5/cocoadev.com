James Tuley a.k.a Jay Tuley

I have a B.S. from UIUC and of my coursework there my favorite subjects were the high level stuff like General/DesignPattern and User Interface Design and ones that had fun MP's like core programing classes and AI. I did all my course work on a Mac without trouble since I started my freshman year when OS X PB was released. Had some interesting projects which I worked on with my friends and classmates such as General/TrailBlazer and General/MusicRecommendation and General/ThreeDeeOhEssTen.  On my own I've been working on a General/MusicBrainz client for Mac, called General/IEatBrainz and Borderlees Cocoa General/QuickTime Player called General/NicePlayer.
