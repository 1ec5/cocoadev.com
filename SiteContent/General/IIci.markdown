Macintosh General/IIci. I guess it could also be the Apple General/IIci. But the Mac General/IIci was even cooler. Mine is standing on end behind my iMac! Eventually I'll either run General/NetBSD on it or 7.5.5 and General/MachTen. Maybe. Right now it's running A/UX, but I can't get that to recognize the network card :( -- General/RobRix

The General/IIci was my first Mac.  It was a wonderful computer.  I learned hypercard, C, C++ on it. Good memories!--General/AlexanderD

Ahhh... General/HyperCard is glorious. I got it on a Mac Plus, and then an LC, and then a 6100, and then a 6500...
