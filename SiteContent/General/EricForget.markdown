Hi!

I'm a long time Mac developer: since 1989 to be precise. I've use heavily General/PowerPlant since CW DR2, for those who remember that! ;-). I've created an extensive class collection for it during that period, called General/BasePlant. You may find more information about that on my web site: http://www.cafederic.com.

I've switched my development to Cocoa around August 2002.

In August 2004, I've finally release my first Cocoa application: iCuistot.
