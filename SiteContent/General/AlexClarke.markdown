Another [[BloodyAussieCocoaDevUser]] (New Zealanders also welcome)

I develop Cocoa apps for fun (profit may come later...=) 
There's nothing sweeter than a couple of cups of Cocoa before bed.
The bread and butter comes from my northern New South Wales based Mac consultancy.

Luckily my honey is very understanding!

From my back verandah I look over the lush green hills of Limsore, occasionally visited by the rainbow lorikeets by day, or the odd Koala, of a night. My two cats curl up on the old sofa. The quiet is gently accented by the soft ticking of keys on a [[PowerBook]] G4. The breeze smells sweet with inflorescence....

This is how I like to program.

I've been into Cocoa since early 2004, before that I coded with [[AppleScript]] for a year or two. Waaaay back in 1982 or so I used to program in BASIC on my C64 - did that for a few years until my voice broke and other interests took over. I've also a decade of professional experience with [[FileMaker]]. 

I have long been enamoured of design technologies, I am a qualified designer with experience in production environments for print, web and video graphics. 
On top of that I'm a bit of a hardware guy, with Apple Certification and 5 years of tech work under my belt. 

I have been running my small consultancy since 1994 - servicing the prolific and diverse Mac using peoples of the region. I'd like to move professionally into App development for OS X as soon as it is feasible - or as soon as I have a worthy app written, whichever comes sooner. Tiger will make the Mac the most exciting place to be, and is going to drive the next phase of Apple's move into the mainstream. As if things could get any more interesting. Why would you develop anywhere else? Oh yeah, the web. Well, it's not as much fun as this! .... : )
