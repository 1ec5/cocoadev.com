In 2004, this was rumored to be Apple's new name for General/RendezVous since they got sued over the use of the old name. Eventually, Apple picked General/BonJour instead, and the transition to the new name publically started in April 2005 with General/OSXTiger. General/OpenTalk was a favorite with fans because of its apparent tie-ins with the old collection of (at the time novel) network technologies **General/AppleTalk**, the technologies that IP and General/BonJour collectively replace.

What's General/WikiFriendly?

    Rendezvous != General/WikiFriendly; General/RendezVous == General/WikiFriendly; General/OpenTalk == General/WikiFriendly && General/WikiFriendly == General/WikiFriendly;

I revised the top section to summarize the General/OpenTalk rumors and the fact that we ended up with General/BonJour instead, as the former text seemed to state that General/OpenTalk was in fact the new name. --General/WooTest
