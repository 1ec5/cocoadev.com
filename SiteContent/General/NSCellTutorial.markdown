Hi, everybody!

I wondered if there are any tutorials for subclassing General/NSCell for making a custom General/NSCell class for use with tableView. So that I can have, for example, an image AND a string in the same cell.

Thank you kindly.

----
Image and text in a cell is no problem.  See /Developer/Examples/General/AppKit/General/DragNDropOutlineView which has 
General/ImageAndTextCell alreday on your hard disk.   You might also want General/NSBrowserCell
