From the Omni Group website:

General/OmniFoundation is The Omni Group's extension to Apple's Foundation framework. Besides several extremely useful extensions to Apple Foundation classes, General/OmniFoundation provides a horde of unique and powerful classes. Among the more interesting are:


*  General/OFStringScanner - A blindingly fast unicode-safe alternative to General/NSStringScanner, for when you really need to burn through those character streams.
*  General/OFRegularExpression - Powerful regular expression processing wrapped in an Objective-C shell. Combine with General/OFStringScanner for extra fun.
*  General/OFTrie - Implementation of the popular trie data structure. Interfaces to General/OFStringScanner for rapid scanning of "longest" token elements.
*  General/OFMessageQueue & General/OFQueueProcessor - Writing stable multithreaded applications is an error prone process. These classes help de-fang the savage beast.


General/OmniFoundation is a veritable treasure chest of programming goodies. Take a look for yourself at http://www.omnigroup.com/developer/sourcecode/
