General/NSCoderNight is a weekly get-together of Cocoa developers in several cities around the world.  More information is at the main General/NSCoderNight web site: http://nscodernight.com/

General/NSCoderNight is a complement to General/CocoaHeads or other user groups.  Where user groups usually have some more formal meeting structure including presentations, General/NSCoderNight is all about just getting together for a couple hours with your fellow Cocoa developers and writing code.

If you want to start a get-together in your own city, just respond to one of the weblog posts and I (General/ChrisHanson) will create a new post for your city that you can use with others in your city to decide on a location.  So far there are General/NSCoderNight get-togethers in the following areas:

- Silicon Valley, CA
- Washington, DC (Tyson's Corner)

There are proposed General/NSCoderNight get-togethers in the following areas:

- San Francisco, CA
- Bangor, ME
- Cologne, Germany

And there's an IRC chat room for General/NSCoderNight on General/FreeNode at irc://irc.freenode.net/nscodernight of course.
