As are many people on this, site, I am a big Mac Dork, and have been for almost my entire life -- I was three when my father brought the original Macintosh, and I was hooked!

I'm also a big Python buff, so I've been using General/PyObjC for almost all my Cocoa development work.  I've got nothing against General/ObjectiveC, but General/PyObjC is just so much... better.
