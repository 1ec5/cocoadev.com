Hi, I'm Eric Smith, born in 1990 from the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, USA. For the last five years or so I've been huge into C# development. Thanks to my PC-- I mean, er, new Mac--I can run Mac OS X finally and learn Cocoa! Unfortunately for me, Cocoa seems to clash with every thing I learned in my years of Visual Basic and C# (what's with all the square brackets!?).

I have a deep, specially reserved hatred for Interface Builder and Xcode. Why do they need to be two separate apps, and why do I need to create a bunch of crap in order to have some code that sets the text of a freakin' label? It all just seems completely unnecessary and counter-productive. Visual Studio this isn't.

But no matter. I adore this operating system and nothing's going to stop me from learning to develop for it (and soon, my iPod touch, bwahaha).
