Perhaps better than [[NeHe]], for one who wants to learn [[OpenGL]] instead of to learn how to do something in [[OpenGL]], is the [[RedBook]].  More theory, more abstract, and more, at least, my pace--  after reading the [[RedBook]] once or twice, I looked at [[NeHe]] and, at each tutorial lesson, read the objective and then wrote the necessary code, and compared to what the tutorial said was correct.  I suppose my approach was more to learn [[OpenGL]] as [[OpenGL]], and not for a specific purpose, but for those who want to gain deep knowledge of the API, I strongly, strongly suggest the [[RedBook]].  It can be found at http://fly.cc.fer.hr/~unreal/theredbook/index.html.

The [[RedBook]] is more an in-depth look at [[OpenGL]] than it is a cookbook.
