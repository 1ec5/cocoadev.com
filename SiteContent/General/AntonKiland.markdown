Been coding since the age of 9. Started out with General/HyperCard, moved on to General/REALbasic.
Today I know Cocoa/C/C++/Java/General/JavaScript/Java Applet/HTML/XHTML/DHTML/CSS/PHP/General/MySQL/General/REALbasic/General/AppleScript/General/ChipmunkBasic
I also can assemble x86 and Rockwell 6502 (Apple 1 and Commodore 64 CPU).
For those interested, my biggest dream is a 3d engine written in Brain Fucking. ^^
