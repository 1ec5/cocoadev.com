Anton Kiland.
Been coding since the age of 9. Started out with [[HyperCard]], moved on to [[REALbasic]].
Today I know Cocoa/C/C++/Java/[[JavaScript]]/Java Applet/HTML/XHTML/DHTML/CSS/PHP/[[MySQL]]/[[REALbasic]]/[[AppleScript]]/[[ChipmunkBasic]]
I also can assemble x86 and Rockwell 6502 (Apple 1 and Commodore 64 CPU).
For those interested, my biggest dream is a 3d engine written in Brain Fucking. ^^

Contact me at [[KattmatMedFisk]] at AIM/iChat, or anton at kiland dot se

I'm always looking for work, so if you need a project employee or just a little something within the areas I know,
don't hesitate to contact me!
