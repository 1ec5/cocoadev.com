A great collection of various useful classes. Worth a few clicks!

-- As of 29 July 2002, the web site seems to be a "stay tuned" page, with self-referential links.

-- As of 21 Septemebr 2002, the web site now correctly directs to the General/MiscKit.com site, though with no new information. I believe this will be changing very shortly as Donald Yacktman et al's book is now published (and on it's way to me) and he now has time to finish up the Kit. Hooray!
----
-- As of 11 February 2003, the website is still the same as it has been for months. Can anyone confirm that Donald Yacktman is even still alive?

-- As of 18 February 2003, the Peanuts archive, ftp://ftp.peanuts.org/Mirrors/General/MiscKit, has version 2.0.5 of the General/MiscKit collection available.
