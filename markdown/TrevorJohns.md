My name is Trevor Johns, and I'm a software developer from California, USA. I love working in Cocoa and Ruby, though I spend a considerable amount of my time working in C, C++, Java, and PHP.

I maintain a personal website at http://tjohns.net. Eventually I'll get around to putting something interesting there.
