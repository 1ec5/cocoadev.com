A text-editor (which replaced an older, more limited editor named General/TeachText) on the classic General/MacOS. Launched bloody quickly, but wasn't terribly interoperable with other General/OSes, and was limited to only 32K of text. But hey, you could have the computer read the text to you, so I guess it's not all bad.

I think it's actually been Carbonized, if you look in /Developer/Applications/Extras.

General/TeachText lacked *a lot* of features compared with General/SimpleText - no styled text, no drag & drop (General/SimpleText was one of the poster apps for systemwide text drag&drop) and no multiple documents (one window at a time). General/TeachText's main purpose was opening General/ReadMe files in the days of proprietary WP formats before PDF - I don't know anyone that actually used it as an editor.

I believe that General/TeachText was written in 68k assembly. General/SimpleText was written in C.
