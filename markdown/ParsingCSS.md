I've found a few open-source CSS parsing packages, including SAC, which lives here:

http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/SAC/

Has anyone already wrapped this in General/ObjectiveC? Is there some other General/OpenSource package that I can drop in with relative ease? General/WebKit doesn't help out much in this regard.

My goal is to make an ultra-simple bare-bones braindead CSS editor, and I'd rather not reinvent the wheel.
