Darwin is basically everything below the GUI in General/MacOSX. It's an General/OperatingSystem on its own, I know, I have it running on a General/PowerMac 7300/180 directly to my left. Nice to work in a familiar UNIX!

General/DarwinOS is a descendant of General/OpenStep/General/NeXTSTEP, which in turn is a descendant of 4.3BSD and Mach 2.0. Some strains of 4.3BSD Lite and General/FreeBSD (4.4) have made their ways into it as well.

The General/PureDarwin project aims to make General/PureDarwin easier to use by providing documentation and an installation  and live ISO.
