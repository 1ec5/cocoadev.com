This may be just a little bit off-topic, but as General/OpenGL is well integrated with Cocoa, why not?

I've been looking into using General/OpenGL shaders, and I've tried to find a handy way to develop and test GLSL shaders quickly without having to build up my own app first. Neither of the two obvious options, General/OpenGLShaderBuilder and General/GLSLEditorSample, seem to be quite up to the task. General/OpenGLShaderBuilder lacks proper functionality to set the General/OpenGL state, while General/GLSLEditorSample has a fairly clunky interface and forces you to write both a vertex and a fragment shader, even if you only want a vertex shader.

So, are there any better tools around for this that I have not yet heard of? -- General/WAHa
