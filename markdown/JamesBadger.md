I started into programming with General/AppleScript, and produced a few applications for a proprietorship I ran under the name "Pineapple Studios." I moved onto Cocoa in late 2003 after not particularly liking General/AppleScript Studio, and made a game utility and an Automator plugin recently. I also explored a bit of web development, learning PHP, CSS, XHTML, and more recently starting out with Ruby on Rails. Started learning C/C++ for university courses a year ago, which has been very useful in improving my novice abilities in PHP/General/ObjC.

Currently, I am studying Geomatics Engineering in Canada.
