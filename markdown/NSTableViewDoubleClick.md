I have an General/NSTableView that has a double click action configured and what I'm wondering is how to get to the entity that table row is referring to.
The corresponding General/NSTableColumn is bound to an General/NSArrayController. And let's say General/NSArrayController controls objects of type Foo.

How can I get access to these Foo objects from within the double click action handler?

TIA
