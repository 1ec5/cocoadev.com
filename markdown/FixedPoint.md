General/FixedPoint is a way of representing non-integer numbers without some of the pitfalls of General/FloatingPoint math. Advantages are speed, particularly on computers without General/FloatingPoint hardware, and exactness; General/FixedPoint does not suffer from the various small calculation errors that tend to exist in General/FloatingPoint code.

Most languages and computers do not have native support for General/FixedPoint arithmetic. Instead, it is handled by storing the General/FixedPoint numbers in normal integers, and manually handling the transformations needed to perform the arithmetic. The basic idea of General/FixedPoint is to multiply the number by a certain factor, such as 256, before storing it in the integer. This gives you some space to use for fractional values, at the expense of range.
