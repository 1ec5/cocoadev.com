This page is almost impossible to find unless you know where it is. So here it is for the record.

http://developer.apple.com/ue/aqua/icons.html

Includes an Aqua Icon design kit, links to icon designers and design tools.

*20 January 2005: This is no longer there. The General/AquaIconKit is no longer available, but Apple has said they plan to update and re-release it.*

However, the General/AquaIconKit *is* available unofficially from mirrors on the General/AquaIconKit page.

*So along with those, have some General/RoyaltyFreeIcons.*
