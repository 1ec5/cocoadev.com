*[...] an Apple Event-based interface that developers may take advantage of in order to provide better integration between their products and General/BBEdit*

This interface is also used by e.g. Xcode for its external editor and it's implemented by General/SubEthaEdit.

*This appears to be untrue -- Xcode uses the API defined by General/MetroWerks General/CodeWarrior*

Also check out General/EditInBBEdit, where you can find a set of classes to add the ODB client side in your cocoa app.
