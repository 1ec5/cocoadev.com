Controller classes are very useful.  It is in the class that you can link your interface widgets to the great coding you have done in other classes.

To create a controller class, go into Interface Builder.  Click on the "Classes" tab of the "General/MainMenu.nib" window.  Find General/NSObject and select it.  Now hit the return key.  This will create a subclass of General/NSObject.  Name this whatever name you want to give your controller class.  To be truely unique you might want to call it General/MyController.

Now save this class into Project Builder by doing this... General/HowToSaveAClassCreatedInInterfaceBuilderToProjectBuilder.

That is it.
