*Actually called General/AMSerialPort*

A collection of two classes to access serial ports. Based on the Serial Port Sample from Apple. Use General/AMSerialPortList to get an array of available serial ports. Get an General/AMSerialPort from there and access it either through its General/NSFileHandle or via the methods defined in the General/AMSerialPortAdditions category.
