The General/BioCocoa framework was originally written to provide developers with the opportunity to add support for reading and writing Clustal, Fasta, GCG-MSF, GDE, NCBI, NEXUS, PDB, Phylip, PIR and S**'wissProt files by writing only three lines of code. Current development is focusing on classes to manipulate sequences, such as translation, digestion and alignment.

The framework is written in Cocoa (Objective-C) and can be used in any Cocoa application. The framework is licensed under the Creative Commons Share-Alike license, and is freely available.

General/BioCocoa developers also on General/CocoaDev include:

*General/MekenTosj
*General/KoenvanderDrift
*General/CharlesParnot


We are looking for developers for our team. If you have a background in bio-science, and love programming in Cocoa, feel free to contact one of the members of the General/BioCocoa team, or visit the General/BioCocoa homepage for more info: http://bioinformatics.org/biococoa/

Version 2.0, which is a complete rewrite, has been released during the WWDC 06 and is available at the website.
