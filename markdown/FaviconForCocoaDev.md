There should be a favicon for General/CocoaDev so it's easier to find among bookmarks, which I am sure all of us have lots of. I whipped up a quick suggestion as a starting point: http://kovs.shacknet.nu/~markus/cocoadev-favicon.png

-- General/MarkusMagnuson

Sounds like a good idea

--General/TomLynch

----

Yes, I dig it as well.

--General/MatthiasGansrigler

----

Very nice. -- General/RobRix

----

I like this idea too, although maybe the 'D' should be lowercase. -- General/KaelB

----

Why lowercase? It's capitalized in the titlebar, not to mention the whole General/CamelCase thing. -- General/RobRix

----

Thanks for doing this!  I've installed it.  -- General/StevenFrank

----

Rejoice! It looks so lovely (: -- General/RobRix

----

You're right, it does look better uppercase.  -- General/KaelB
