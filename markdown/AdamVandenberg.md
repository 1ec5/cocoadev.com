Just another programmer. Learning Cocoa and OS X development.

**General/NSTableView Demo:** http://flangy.com/dev/osx/tableviewdemo/ Shows an General/NSTableView with an editable data source and customized data cells. Please feel free to comment on the code in here; I'm still new to Objective-C and Cocoa so I don't know how idiomatic any of it is.

**General/AllowNilFormatter:** A formatter that preserves null values in fields, and displays them as <null> in red (or any attributed string you want to set.)

*Your comments here:*

**Adam's name ends in "berg." That is very cool. I like berg as a suffix.**

Hmm, that's interesting. Why don't we start a list of things that end in "berg" (that aren't names)?

*Iceberg
*Iceberg (this time it's the lettuce)


hmmm... what's so cool of the 'berg' suffix?
(van den) Berg is a very common surname in dutch, and means sth like 'off the mountain' or from the mountains, but imagine; there's not one single mountain in holland... :)  -arri
