Newly-minted physicist and spare-time Mac OS X developer working with Fishback Research. First serious project was Fishpad. Was the lead developer with the long-defunct Dry Creek Software.

Working on several new projects with Fishback, along with co-developers Justin Jones and Brenda Dolan.

I also do really stupid work with Fortran 77 on linux clusters for a paycheck. I would go nuts if I didn't have my iBook on my desk next to me.
