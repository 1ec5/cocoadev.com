A General/MacOS development framework that has been around since 1994.  It is written in C++ and was supplied with Metrowerks' General/CodeWarrior environment.  After General/CodeWarrior's discontinuation in 2005, Freescale released General/PowerPlant, General/PowerPlantX, and Constructor as General/OpenSourceSoftware.  They are available on sourceforge at http://open-powerplant.sourceforge.net/
