The extra CD of tools included in OS X to let you make programs and so on. Compilers, debuggers, and other little utilities.
In later OS versions that install from a DVD, there is, of course, no "extra CD".

No CD: see General/WhereToGetApplesCocoaCompiler from General/AppleDeveloperConnection

Once you have the General/DeveloperTools packages, be sure to perform the installation on the same partition where OS X is installed.
