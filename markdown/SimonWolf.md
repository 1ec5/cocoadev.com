I've been a software developer since the mid-1990s but, despite being a Mac user at home since 2003, didn't get my teeth into Cocoa development until the start of 2008. Fortunately my employer decided that we needed to write an application which was best suited to OS X and as the resident Mac fan the task fell to me. I managed to learn Cocoa in work time (and was sent to WWDC 08 at their expense) which had made the whole process quicker and more achievable and it is not only a massively fun challenge but it has also revitalised by love of software development.

As of late-November 2008 I'm in the early stages of writing a couple of applications which I will release under my own Otter Software business.
