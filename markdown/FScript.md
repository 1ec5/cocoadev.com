F-Script is a lightweight object-oriented interactive and scripting layer specifically designed for Cocoa. F-Script provides scripting and interactive access to Cocoa frameworks and custom Objective-C objects. It aims to be a useful and fun tool for both beginners and experts, allowing interactively exploring, testing and using Cocoa-based objects and frameworks. It includes a smalltalk-like scripting language and a powerful graphical object browser for interacting with Cocoa objects. It also includes support for General/CoreData in the form of General/CoreDataExplorer, a set of tools for exploring and manipulating General/CoreData objects. F-Script is based on the General/OOPALProgrammingModel, a high level programming model for querying and manipulating objects.
F-Script is open source.

Just thought I'd add some graffiti: General/FScript and General/FScriptAnywhere are SO useful! Especially if you've ever gotten used to say, using python and Tk to prototype an app... -- General/MichaelMcCracken

The thing I like most about General/FScript is General/FScriptAnywhere. If you've ever wanted to explore someone else's Cocoa app, this is the way to do it. One click and you can load the General/FScript interpreter into any running Cocoa app and have interactive access to its internals. Try it! -- General/PeterMonty
