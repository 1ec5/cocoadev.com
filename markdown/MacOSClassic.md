Any General/MacOS pre- General/MacOSX, Excluding A/UX

Had the luxury of being able to back up your system with a option drag, so you could safely meddle with everything you were not supposed to.

General/ResEdit and General/MacsBug were quite useful, and the General/MacintoshToolbox was the API

*Note: It was not actually called **Mac OS** until System 7.6, prior to that release it was just known as System, i.e. System 5.1, System 7.1, etc...**
