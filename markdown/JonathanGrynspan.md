I'm a programmer in Toronto, Ontario. I primarily use C, Objective-C, Java, C#, and Visual Basic (but the last one only when necessary! Ew!) for my various projects.

If you're hiring, give me a ring. My website is at http://www.ghosttiger.com, and my r�sum� is available on request.

My biggest project so far (and the first one to mint me any coin, to date) has been mFurc, a port of the Furcadia game client to Mac OS X. You can learn more about it, and download the program, at http://www.ghosttiger.com/mfurc/.

I've chosen the prefix "GT" for my public projects. The following are the ones I've released so far:


* General/GTResourceFork, a Cocoa wrapper for the Resource Manager - http://www.ghosttiger.com/?p=117
* An Objective-C asynchronous messaging system - http://www.ghosttiger.com/?p=130
* General/GTSubscription, a Cocoa wrapper for the Carbon file system subscription system - http://www.ghosttiger.com/?p=132
* An asynchronous keyboard state reader - http://www.ghosttiger.com/?p=136
