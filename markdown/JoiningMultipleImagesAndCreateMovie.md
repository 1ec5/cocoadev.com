Hi, I'm rather new at Cocoa...is there a way to get multiple images, join it together...and create a quicktime movie in cocoa programming?  When the movie is played...it will be shown like a film strip..with the images streaming from right to left continuously.

*This is really a question about how to use General/QuickTime. Cocoa has classes for loading and displaying still images, but it's a Graphical User Interface library, not a multimedia toolkit. General/QuickTime, on the other hand, has all sorts of wonderful and arcane facilities for doing just what you're asking.

Perhaps you should visit http://developer.apple.com, and see if there's any General/QuickTime sample code there that could give you a few pointers?

And a more general question for the General/CocoaDev crowd: is there a site like General/CocoaDev, but which focusses on General/QuickTime?

There's no General/QuickTime wiki that I'm aware of, but Apple has a mailing list - [http://lists.apple.com/mailman/listinfo/quicktime-api]
