General/ActionScript is a developing technology created by Macromedia exclusively for Flash. It is very similar to General/JavaScript and other object-oriented languages.
One of the main goals of General/ActionScript is that it runs on the objects, and not through methods or functions (although they are available too). To know more about General/ActionScript, please visit http://www.macromedia.com/ (and most likely search for a while).
