Since General/CocoaDev is a community site, we could use some direction.

Add any tasks/guidelines you think are needed that don't require modification to how the site works, and use this page to get some ideas on what you can do for the site.

Improvements:

* additional content in the General/CocoaGlossary is always a good idea.
* make the General/AppKit and General/FoundationKit sections more useful by turning the class pages (General/NSString, General/NSArray, et cetera) into class references with more and better content than Apple's equivalents. Samples of how to use them are also an excellent idea.
* some new General/RecentTutorials would be good, perhaps one on assembler (aiming at General/RobRix here **What the heck do people think *I* know about assembler? All I can do is get myself in trouble with it!**)? Perhaps they meant General/KritTer? **One can only hope.**
* we need more pages like the one on General/MemoryManagement. That page is generally informative about a pertinent developer topic, and brings together a lot of information both on and off-site.


Maintenance:

* General/CocoaDiscussions needs old conversations moved to General/RetiredDiscussions or refactored to be information pages, as discussions are off-putting for those just looking for information.
* we can always use more General/CocoaSampleCode and General/CocoaTutorials and General/TipsAndTricks, so if you've got something along those lines, by all means share it!
* check new users have \\%\\%BEGINENTRY\\%\\%General/CocoaDevUsers\\%\\%ENDENTRY\\%\\% on their user pages; similarly for other topics, like General/CocoaDiscussions and General/CocoaGlossary

My advice on General/WhenDiscussionsConclude is just to orphan the page. If a question comes up enough to annoy people, we can find a place to put it, but I don't think C**'ocoaAnsweredQuestions would be it. Far better to create a logical system, perhaps attaching the question to the class that provokes it, or the relevant section of the General/CocoaGlossary. If people don't check there first, they won't scour a less organized system.

Since we have General/CocoaDiscussions already, no need for a C**'ocoaUnansweredQuestions. -- General/KritTer

How about a cocoadev specific browser? Not a web browser - we have enough these days. I'm thinking more of a content browser that just happens to get all/most of its data from here. Think Watson or Sherlock - a 'native' interface would be nice, right?

**Got that!**

What possible use would the search feature of this site be if answered questions were deleted? Orphaning and refactoring pages is fine, but deleting them outright is just wrong. I can guarantee that if this happened, you'd see the same questions asked far more than twice.
