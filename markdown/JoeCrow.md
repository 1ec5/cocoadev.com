I am studying General/ComputerScience (B.S.) and Philosophy (B.A.) at Lafayette College in Easton, PA.  I highly recommend our department to anyone who wants to study General/ComputerScience with a typical class size less than 10 students and do undergrad research. I'd be happy to tell you more.

I am currently the lead and sole developer of Meteorologist, a free and open "desktop" weather program for Mac OS X.  If you'd like to help me with the project, I'd love your help.  Contact me: this page's title @gmail.com.  Also, checkout http://sourceforge.net/projects/heat-meteo/

While working on Meteorologist, General/CocoaDev has often been my saviour.  Thanks General/CocoaDev!
