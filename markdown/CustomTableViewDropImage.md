Hi

Normally when you drag something over a General/TableView row, it outlines the row in black.  How can i customize what is drawn?  I have looked through all of the General/TableView methods and have found nothing for this (and no way to determine if the row is the one the drag is hovering over, otherwise I would just use the row drawing method).  Thanks for any help
