My day job is at Hewlett-Packard in their storage management division working as a software architect on large (mostly) Java based cross-platform applications. Before HP I worked a small company called Transoft (later Transoft Networks) that developed a shared storage solution called General/FibreNet for Mac OS used heavily by media/video/movie houses (like Disney, Saban Entertainment... sorry about the Power Rangers, etc.). HP bought this company and that is how I am where I am today. :-)

I have a relatively long history in storage technology in particular SCSI protocols, Fibre Channel, and now iSCSI, SMI-S. I have written and maintained Fibre Channel drivers for Mac OS, Mac OS X, and Window NT/2000.

Of course I prefer working on Mac OS X and developing using Cocoa (first exposed to General/OpenStep/General/NextStep on General/NeXT systems during college work). My side project is Freetime Software ( http://www.freetimesw.com )

I live and work in Santa Barbara, California, USA. I went to college at UC Santa Barbara and studied Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE).
