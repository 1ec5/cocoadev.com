I'm an Electrical Engineering student at Tulane University.  I've taken a couple semesters worth of programming, using C/C++, but Cocoa is new to me.  I'm writing a Cocoa app for configuring Apache as my senior project.  So far so good, but getting access to root-owned files is gonna be a pain in the neck.  More about me later, if I ever have time. ;-)
