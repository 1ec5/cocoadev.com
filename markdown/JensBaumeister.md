27 years old, from Germany, Cologne.

Knows his way around HTML, XML, XSL, Java, Perl and SQL, but Obj-C and Cocoa is rather new to him.

Finished a few small private Cocoa-Projects in General/ObjC.

Current project involves using General/DistributedObjects, General/RendezVous and creating tons of General/MemoryLeaks in the process. :-)

When not doing Cocoa-related stuff, Jens used to be working for Bullex ( http://www.bullex.de ) coding interactive web games.

Now however he's completely changed gears and going to film school learning hw to be a screen writer. In his spare time he still likes programming for fun and profit, though. :-)
