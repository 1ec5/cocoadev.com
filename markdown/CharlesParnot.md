Charles Parnot

Biologist, always looking for a good excuse to write some Cocoa code to analyze data.

I contributed to:

*
General/PerlObjCBridge (with some code in General/AddSystemFramework)
*
General/XCodeAndNibFilesWithCVS
*
General/SavingFilePackageWithManySmallIndependentFiles
*
General/XGridDummyPlugin
*
General/HowToGetHardwareAndNetworkInfo


These are links of things I like or want to remember, so I like to have shortcuts to them:

*General/AspectCocoa
*General/FastTextRenderingInNSView
*General/AltivecOptimization
