Metrowerks General/CodeWarrior for Macintosh was a popular IDE for Classic and Carbon development, with a project manager; text editor; Pascal, C, C++, Objective-C, and Java compilers and linkers; and debuggers.

General/CodeWarrior for Mac was discontinued in 2005, around the time of Apple's announced switch to Intel General/CPUs. The last release was General/CodeWarrior Pro 10.

General/CodeWarrior supported Objective-C and Cocoa development, but was never very popular amongst Cocoa developers.  It did not support newer language features like @synchronized and had no built in Cocoa documentation.  On the other hand, it's compiler and linker were significantly faster than Apple's development tools of the time.  General/CodeWarrior was never able to build General/UniversalBinaries.

As of this writing (early 2008), General/CodeWarrior Pro 10 continues to partly work on Mac OS X 10.5 and earlier.  For best results, the 10.3 or earlier SDK should be used, as later General/SDKs cause compiler errors with some headers.  Compiling and linking seem to work OK, but debugging does not.

Many Mac developers were big fans of General/CodeWarrior.  The Metrowerks sessions at WWDC and General/MacHack were well liked.
