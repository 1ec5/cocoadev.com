Dr. Scott Steinman


I'm a former professor of vision science, now on disability. 

I started out on the VIC-20/Commodore-64, Amiga, DEC PDP-11/73, PCs (both DOS and Windows) and then... (sigh of relief)... the Mac. I've programmed in BASIC, 6802 and 680x0 assembly, FORTRAN, C, C++, Java, Eiffel, FoxPro, Prograph CPX, Frontier, LabVIEW, REALbasic and Cocoa.

My vision science class courses used my Mac software to demonstrate visual phenomena and simulate visual neurophysiological processes and clinical vision tests, while all of my research after 1990 was all done with Macs (C++, Prograph CPX, or General/RealBASIC).  My educational software is was donated for use by professors around the world.  At a previous job, I constructed and programmed a clinic for measuring the visual capabilities of infants using... you guessed it... the Mac (General/LabVIEW, C++, Frontier on two linked Macs -- See General/MacTech).  Oh yeah, I also published a book a few years ago on visual OOP with Prograph CPX on the Mac (see General/ProGraph).

Now I'm (very) slowly relearning Objective-C/Cocoa and picking up General/MacRuby on the days when I can function to some extent.
