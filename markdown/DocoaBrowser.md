General/DocoaBrowser is a utility application that displays Apple's Cocoa framework documentation (both Java and Objective-C flavors) as well as your own General/AutoDoc documentation. General/AutoDoc documentation can be displayed from HTML files as well generated on the fly from your Objective-C project directory (General/AutoDoc 2.0b8 is included in General/DocoaBrowser's bundle) .

General/DocoaBrowser is based on General/CocoaBrowser by Hoshi Takanori and others and is now hosted at Source Forge
