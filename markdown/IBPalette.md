One thing that caught me off guard that I thought I would share. If a palette that you create is able to run fine in IB, but raises the exception "General/NSInvalidUnarchiveOperationException" when you try to run an application that uses a control from the palette, you probably forgot to add the custom view to the target membership of the application (e.g. if the custom view is the class General/DotView, you have to add "General/DotView.h" and "General/DotView.m" to the target). IB loads the object code for General/DotView from the palette, but your application will load the object code for General/DotView from it's own bundle.

If you create a custom class and you want to put it in an General/IBPalette, you have to implement General/NSCoding.

Palette projects on General/CocoaDev:

*General/GenericToolbar by General/JediKnil: General/NSToolbar in Interface Builder
*General/FoundationCollectionsPalette by General/KritTer: A palette that allows you to add N<nowiki/>General/SArrays and N<nowiki/>General/SDictionaries to your nib file.
*General/RBSplitView
**anyone else?*


See also http://docs.sun.com/db/doc/802-2110/6i63kq4uj?a=view -- Sun's General/OpenStep documentation for General/IBPalette (and the rest of the General/InterfaceBuilder.framework). It's fairly out-of-date, but better than most of what Apple has. You'll have to compare with the current framework headers to make your palette work.

If anyone wants help with General/IBPalette-related problems, just ask me. I've run into (and still am hitting) most of them making General/GenericToolbar. --General/JediKnil

Does anyone know what Tools > Palettes > New Palette (in the Interface Builder menu bar) is supposed to do? It creates a new palette (named "untitled"), but what can you do with it after that?

*According to Apple's docs:*

*ï¿½ What is a dynamic palette and how do I make one?*

*Dynamic palettes are custom palettes created by the user. Select the menu item Tools > Palettes > New Palette. A blank palette is created for you. You can now Option-drag widgets from the design window onto the palette. Option-drags containing multiple widgets come off the palette as one unit. Save the palette using the menu item Tools > Palettes > Save.*

I am looking for a NIB palette that shows a one month calendar view (Like iCal)

----

try General/ObjectLibrary

----

Or even better, in Tiger at least, use a General/NSDatePicker control and set the style to "Graphical". This gives you exactly the same control as in iCal or System Prefs.

----
Where are these put when they're installed?

----
If I'm not mistaken, they stay where they were at when you add them, and IB simply links to it from there.
