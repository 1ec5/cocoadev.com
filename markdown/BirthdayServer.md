- Yes that's me! - Please, take the General/BirthdayServer code and use as you like. The General/NetSocket library is under a BSD license (or similar) I think - General/DavidThorpe

- This is now redundant as modern versions of iCal can do this now. However, the Cocoa HTTP server embedded within it may still be useful - General/DavidThorpe, 7 September 2006
