Rhapsody was the "next-generation" operating system that General/AppleComputer had been working on before they renamed it General/MacOSX.

It was basically General/NeXT's General/NeXTSTEP/General/OpenStep operating system repurposed for Apple hardware, after General/NeXT was acquired by Apple.

A lot of the Really Amazing Stuff in General/MacOSX was first thought of in connection with Rhapsody. For instance, the General/BlueBox which we now call Classic was originally intended to run System 7.x (that old!). And Rhapsody was going to have the General/YellowBox, which eventually became Cocoa, which we all know and love. Finally, full Java support was a Big Thing about Rhapsody, and as you can see, it's paid off: Java in OS X *works*.

Besides Aqua and Quartz and all the other wonderful technologies in General/MacOSX, the biggest change since Rhapsody is probably the invention of Carbon. Carbon allows lazy (and/or efficient...call it what you like) developers to continue using most of their Classic Mac OS codebase and only update a little bit of the code so that their program will work in General/MacOSX, instead of rewriting it with Cocoa. I don't know that I can blame them, but it seems that it's easier to write a nice Cocoa application than it is to write a nice Carbon one (your mileage may vary).

Another Child of General/AppleRhapsody was General/MacOSX Server 1.x. It came before Aqua, and had 48x48 .tiff based icon files.

*And a Cocoa Finder... sigh*

Anyone got any pics? Did it look like Mac OS < 10?

The full Rhapsody strategy, if it was ever carried out, would have made Rhapsody 'the Java of General/OSes'. It would have ran on x86, General/PowerPC and possibly Alpha CPU architectures, and developers could compile the same code for each and ship a single 'obese binary' package that would run on all of them

Some of that is already coming to pass with Universal Binaries in the General/PowerPC -> x86 transition. -- General/JoshuaPenn

Ick! Personally, I'm happy with the way things are looking now-a-days. If the Mac OS looked like that today, well, it wouldn't have enticed many to switch no matter how rock-solid. I used to be a Mac basher just a few years ago. I bashed Windows almost as much, don't get me wrong, but I always had it out for the Mac's look and feel ... it bothered me. A lot. ;-) At any rate, I am now proud to say I own only one PC and several Macs. The PC has Linux on it and hasn't been powered up in nearly two years. And it took OS X / Cocoa to get me back into software development after a very long hiatus due to my Java Strike (TM). Man ... I'm really judgmental ... ;-)

Actually, the 'Rhapsody strategy' someone mentioned above was fully executed with General/OpenStep and General/NeXTStep, both of which ran on a variety of architectures (and even on top of other operating systems). -- General/FinlayDobbie

*Fully, except for the General/PowerPC part.*
