The area at the top right of the screen (in the menu bar) - That contains General/NSStatusItem s

Of course, that image is a menu extra, no? -- General/RobRix (Are General/NSMenuExtra<nowiki/>s subclasses of General/NSStatusItem<nowiki/>s?)

Yes, General/NSMenuExtra<nowiki/>s are a sort of General/NSStatusItem, and as far as the actual objects go General/NSMenuExtra inherits from General/NSStatusItem. Of course, they're implemented very differently. --General/FinlayDobbie

It would certainly seem so.
