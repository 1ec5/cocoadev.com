I spend most of my time working for my company http://calftrail.com, writing Mac software to help geotag, organize, and enjoy photos. I also love to work with geo and cartographic technologies for food.

My "glob of nerdishness" is on my personal site at http://www.extinguishedscholar.com/wpglob/.

See http://code.google.com/u/calftrail/ and http://bitbucket.org/calftrail/ for some of my open source contributions.
