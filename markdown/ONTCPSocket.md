General/ONTCPSocket is a class within the General/OmniNetworking framework that supports the creation and management of TCP client and server sockets.  While  much of the functionality is exposed through the interface of its parent class General/ONInternetSocket, General/ONTCPSocket exposes the ability to control certain TCP-specific connection details such as Nagle's algorithm.
