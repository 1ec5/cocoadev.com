My name is Denis Gryzlov. I'm the lead (and only) developer at meeu labs 
( Link: http://meeu.me/ )

I'm 24 years old, currently live in Moscow, Russia.
**miniStat2** widget is probably the most popular thing I made for Mac with Cocoa. All my other widgets have been downloaded by thousands users, and were in Apple's Top10 for weeks.
