This is a useful class that you will never use directly, but might help debug problems related to multithreading. Recall that General/AppKit isn't thread safe, so you have to be sure you're only drawing from the main thread... IF <code>OMNI_ASSERTIONS_ON</code> is defined, General/OAThreadCheckingView will pose as General/NSView and check assertions every time any view calls <code> lockFocus, setNeedsDisplay, </code> or <code>setNeedsDisplayInRect</code> to be sure that the call is coming from the main thread.
