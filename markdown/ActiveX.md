Question: Is there an equivalent to General/ActiveX on Mac OS X?

Answer: No.

If you want to display interactive media through your Cocoa application, you can use Flash content via General/WebKit's General/WebView, or General/QTKit's General/QTMovieView. If you want to display General/PDFs, use General/PDFKit. Several things that would be packaged as General/ActiveX controls (like calendars, PDF viewers, web browsers, etc.) on Windows are implemented as custom controls on Mac OS X.
