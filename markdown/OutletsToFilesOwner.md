To add an outlet to General/FilesOwner, first create a class as normal (subclassing whatever is appropriate - General/NSWindowController perhaps) and then add outlets to it as normal. Then go to the General/FilesOwner object in the nib and set its custom class (in the info panel) to your class. You should then be able to connect everything up.
