Does some body know how to create a General/NSTextView who contains HTML source code with colors for each tags ? General/OmniGroup's frameworks maybe do it but which ones ?
Thanks.

Do the General/OmniGroup's frameworks include HTML syntax highlighting?

Not that I'm aware of, but General/IDEKit does (GPL)
