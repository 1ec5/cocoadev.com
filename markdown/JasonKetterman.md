Yup, My name's Jason, also known all over the web as Anshar, Ansh, General/AnshXP, Ansh-kakashi, heh...I have a ton of names. I'm 17 now, and I've had my mac for ... 2 Months now! ^^ I live in the US, but I'll be moving to Japan after college. I'm studying Japanese, and am fairly fluent in that and Spanish. My English lacks the most even though it's my native language. -_-; I know it's pathetic.

Anyhow, I just got a mac not too long ago, and I started programming in Cocoa, I really like it. It's alot better than alot of other programming environments. It's really simple too, but I'm not used to Objective-C yet.

Hope I can help other people if you have any problems or need anything. ^^ I'll be in the chatroom alot from now on (at least until school starts).
