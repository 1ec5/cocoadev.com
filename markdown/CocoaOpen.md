I would have thought that hiving off inactive projects - in the sense that the sources are no longer available on the web - would be a better first move. Many older projects are plenty useful to for us to learn from. You can find recent projects (and much more) at http://osx.hyperjeff.net/Apps/apps?s=on&t=1&w=4 , one of the sites given as an "other link".
