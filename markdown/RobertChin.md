I've been a Mac developer since the original release of OS X. I'm currently attending the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where I am a member of the General/MacWarriors MUG.

Currently the only major project that I'm involved with is General/NicePlayer.

Previously, I've been a part in the development of:

  * The iTunes Music Recommendation System
  * General/TrailBlazer
  * 3DOSX
  * General/PrintSelection
  * General/ActiveTimer
