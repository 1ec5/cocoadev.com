Windows/.NET software development for a large automation company pays the bills, Cocoa development is just for fun... for the time being. I've been programming professionally since about 1985.

My (very spare time) Cocoa project is T<nowiki/>inyELF [http://www.tinyelf.com], an emulator of old computers based on RCA's 1802 microprocessor. My blog [http://www.ruske.com] occasionally touches on Cocoa related topics.
