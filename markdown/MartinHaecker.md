Hi there, I'm a computer science student from Berlin, Germany

I'm an avid reader of the C2 wiki, dayly reader of http://www.osnews.com/ and http://www.macupdate.com/index.php?os=macosx.

My latest project is General/MyBlocks an implementation of small anonymous functions, very similar to Smalltalk Blocks (but sadly some things aren't possible).

You can reach me at spamfaenger (at) gmx.de and on my website http://dwt.de.vu/

Have Phun!
Martin

p.s.: I'd like to complain how sad it is that Unicode isn't ubiquitous... In Real-Life I am called *Martin Hï¿½cker*, but of course this wiki hickups when I try that as a link. :(
