A file containing information that developers/users should read before continuing on with an application.

What does everyone think should be standard fare for an application General/ReadMe file? Feel free to add onto this list:


* The purpose of the application *(it's amazing how vague some descriptions are.. I've downloaded things that looked interesting and discovered I really had no clue what it was supposed to do, even after reading the General/ReadMe.)*
* Installation/Uninstallation instructions
* Basic usage
* Contact/support info
* Version history


----

The user should be able to access this information from within the app, as well. There are three places where they can go: the app menu, the About dialog, and the Help menu.

Basic usage should be the first page in the app's Help book. I like to include a paragraph briefly describing the app in the About dialog, and two buttons for the credits and release notes/version history. -- General/DustinVoss

How do you add the buttons to the General/AboutBox?  Or do you use a custom General/AboutBox?

I use a custom box.

I think putting version history in the General/ReadMe is alright if you've only got a few versions, but if it gets lengthy, create a General/ChangeLog file instead. That way you don't make readers feel overwhelmed by text when they open up the General/ReadMe and see that the scroll bar grip is 2 pixels tall. -- General/GarrettMurray

That's a mighty short scroll bar grip.

*It's actually almost possible on Windoze. The Mac thankfully constrains the grip's size to a reasonable value.*
